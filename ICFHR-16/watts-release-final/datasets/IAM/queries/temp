BY

THE

WHETHER

WAS

A

CENTRAL

AND

-
TODAY
-
FOR
EXAMPLE
-
THE
FOREIGN
MINISTER
OF
INDO
NESIA
ARRIVED
IN
BELGRADE
AS
THE
GUEST
OF
THE
YUGOSLAV
FOREIGN
MINISTER
-
IN
FACT
SUCH
YUGOSLAV
ACTIVITY
HAS
BEEN
-
PARTICULARLY
INTENSIFIED
IN
THE
PAST
YEAR
OR
SO
AND
THOUGH
SO
FAR
-
APART
FROM
JOINT
ACTION
IN
THE
UNITED
NATIONS
-
THESE
EXCHANGES
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
SEEN
ON
ANY
WIDER
BASIS
-
PRESIDENT
TITO
IS
KNOWN
FOR
SOME
TIME
TO
HAVE
FAVOURED
A
CONFERENCE
OF
NEUTRALIST
LEADERS
-
THE
WISH
WAS
PARTICULARLY
APPARENT
IN
COMMENTS
IN

-
IN
YUGOSLAV
APPROVAL
OF
THE
IDEA
OF
AN
INTERAFRICAN
CONSULTATIVE
ASSEMBLY
WHICH
WOULD
COORDINATE
ACTIVITY
ON
THE
POLITICAL
AND
ECONOMIC
TITO
WOULD
LIKE
SOME
SUCH
IDEA
EXTENDED
ALSO
TO
THE
WHOLE
UNCOMMITTED
WORLD
BUT
HE
NOW
FEELS
-
IN
VIEW
OF
A
CHANGED
INTERNATIONAL
SITUATION
AND
ESPECIALLY
IN
VIEW
OF
FRESH
PROBLEMS
FACING
THE
NEW
AND
INDEPENDENT
COUNTRIES
OF
AFRICA
-
THAT
THE
TIME
IS
RIPE
TO
HAVE
MORE
FREQUENT
CONSULTATIONS
BETWEEN
THE
UNCOMMITTED
COUNTRIES
AND
EVEN
TO
WORK
OUT
COMMON
STANDS
ON
VARIOUS
PROBLEMS
FACING
THOSE
NATIONS
-
TWO
SUBJECTS
-
THE
CONGO
AND
ALGERIA
-
ARE
THE
MAIN
TOPICS
OF
THE
TALKS
IN
BELGRADE
-
AND
ON
BOTH
THE
TWO
LEADERS
HAVE
IDENTICAL
IDEAS
-
TWO
EMISSARIES
FROM
THE
LAOTIAN
GOVERNMENT
OF
PRINCE
BOUN
OUM
HAVE
ARRIVED
IN
PHNOM
PENH
-
CAMBODIA
-
TO
INVITE
PRINCE
SOUVANNA
PHOUMA
-
THE
FORMER
PRIME
MIN
ISTER
-
TO
RETURN
TO
LAOS
-
NO
DETAILS
OF
THEIR
MISSION
HAVE
BEEN
DISCLOSED
-
BUT
IT
WAS
REPORTED
EARLIER
IN
LAOS
THAT
PRINCE
BOUN
OUM
WAS
CONSIDERING
ASKING
GOVERNMENT
-
PRINCE
SOUVANNA
PHOUMA
HAS
NOT
YET
REPLIED
TO
THE
MISSION
-
BUT
RECENT
STATEMENTS
MADE
BY
HIM
IN
PHNOM
PENH
INDICATE
THAT
HE
STILL
REGARDS
HIMSELF
AS
THE
ONLY
LEGAL
PRIME
MINISTER
OF
LAOS
-
HIS
POLICY
OF
STRICT
NEUTRALITY
FROM
1951
TO
1958
KEPT
THE
KINGDOM
IN
PEACE
-
THOUGH
AT
THE
COST
OF
VIRTUAL
PARTITION
OF
THE
COUNTRY
INTO
THE
PROCOMMUNIST
NORTH
AND
THE
PROWESTERN
CENTRE
AND
SOUTH
-
PRINCE
SOUVANNAS
FORMER
MINISTER
OF
LAOS
-
YESTERDAY
ADDRESSED
ALL
OFFICERS
OCCUPYING
THE
PROVINCE
OF
XIENG
THIS
EMPHASIS
ON
THE
LEGALITY
OF
THE
FORMER
GOVERNMENT
SUGGESTS
THAT
ALL
IS
NOT
WELL
WITH
THE
POLITICAL
AND
MILITARY
LEADERSHIP
OF
THE
PROCOMMUNISTS
-
MOST
OF
THE
PROVINCE
OF
XIENG
KHOUANG
AND
THE
TACTICALLY
USEFUL
PLAIN
OF
JARS
-
HOWEVER
-
APPEAR
STILL
TO
BE
FIRMLY
IN
THEIR
HANDS
-
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
CLAIMED
THE
RECAPTURE
OF
VANG
VIENG
-
THE
PRO
COMMUNISTS
FORMER
BASE
60
MILES
NORTH
OF
VIENTIANE
-
BUT
THIS
CLAIM
A
CORRESPONDENT
WHO
TRAVELLED
YESTERDAY
TO
WITHIN
A
FEW
MILES
OF
VANG
VIENG
WAS
TOLD
BY
OFFICERS
THAT
WITH
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
SUNNING
HIMSELF
IN
JAMAICA
AND
-
HIS
CABINET
OUT
IN
THE
GRASS
ROOTS
MAKING
160
SPEECHES
IN
80
CONSTITUENCIES
IN
10
DAYS
-
THE
LIBERAL
PARTY
ARE
HOLDING
A
NATIONAL
CONFERENCE
HERE
WITH
SOME
2000
DELEGATES
-
THE
BIGGEST
GATHERING
SINCE
1958
WHEN
MR
LESTER
PEARSON
WAS
CHOSEN
AS
PARTY
LEADER
-
IN
SOME
WAYS
IT
WILL
BE
A
TESTING
OCCASION
UNASSAILABLE
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NO
ONE
ELSE
IN
SIGHT
TO
SUPPLANT
HIM
-
SO
THE
CON
FERENCE
WILL
CONCENTRATE
ON
LAYING
THE
FOUNDATIONS
ON
WHICH
TO
WIN
THE
NEXT
ELECTION
-
THE
RALLY
COMES
AT
A
TIME
WHEN
IN
SPITE
OF
CAREFULLY
WORDED
STATE
MENTS
BY
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
THERE
IS
AN
AIR
OF
ELECTORAL
EXPECTANCY
-
MEMBERS
OF
THE
CABINET
ARE
BASING
THEIR
SPEECHES
ON
A
NEW
CONSERVATIVE
BOOKLET
CALLED
THE
RECORD
SPEAKS
WHICH
OUTLINES
IN
SOME
DETAIL
THE
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
OF
THE
PARTY
SINCE
IT
CAME
TO
OFFICE
THREE
AND
A
HALF
YEARS
AGO
-
NEVERTHELESS
THERE
IS
LITTLE
ILLUSION
IN
THE
CONSERVATIVE
PARTY
THAT
THEIR
STOCK
AT
HOME
HAS
FALLEN
IN
THE
FACE
OF
HEAVY
UNEMPLOYMENT
AND
AN
UNCERTAIN
ECONOMY
-
LAST
YEAR
SAW
THE
DEFEAT
OF
TWO
CONSERVATIVE
PROVINCIAL
GOVERNMENTS
-
QUEBEC
AND
NEW
BRUNSWICK
-
AND
IN
THE
FOUR
FEDERAL
BYELECTIONS
LAST
OCTOBER
THE
PARTY
FARED
BADLY
-
THEY
ARE
NOW
FACED
WITH
FOUR
OTHER
BY
ELECTIONS
-
ONE
AT
ESQUIMALT
SAANICH
-
BRITISH
COLUMBIA
-
ONE
IN
LEEDS
-
ONTARIO
-
AND
THE
OTHER
TWO
IN
THE
MARITIMES
-
RESTIGOUCHE
MADAWASKA
-
NEW
BRUNSWICK
-
AND
KINGS
-
PRINCE
EDWARD
ISLAND
-
ALL
FOUR
WERE
CONSERVATIVE
STRONGHOLDS
-
LAST
SEPTEMBER
A
PUBLIC
POLL
SHOWED
THAT
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
SINCE
THE
ADMINISTRATION
CAME
TO
POWER
IN
1957
THE
LIBERALS
WERE
AHEAD
-
43
PER
CENT
WERE
IN
FAVOUR
OF
-
THE
GRITS
-
IF
A
FEDERAL
ELECTION
HAD
BEEN
HELD
LAST
AUTUMN
-
38
PER
CENT
FOR
THE
CONSERVATIVES
AND
12
PER
CENT
FOR
THE
CCF
-
-
HOWEVER
-
A
SEPARATE
POLL
REVEALED
THAT
MR
DIEFENBAKER
WAS
STILL
AHEAD
IN
TERMS
OF
POPULARITY
AS
AN
INDIVIDUAL
LEADER
-
FOR
MR
DIEFENBAKER
36
PER
CENT
-
FOR
MR
PEARSON
34
PER
CENT
-
-
HOW
FAR
IS
MR
LESTER
PEARSON
ACCEPTABLE
TO
THE
PEOPLE
OF
CANADA
AS
A
PRIME
MINISTER
-
MANY
OBSERVERS
AT
THE
NATIONAL
RALLY
WILL
BE
SEEKING
AN
ANSWER
-
IT
IS
DIFFICULT
FOR
MANY
TO
SEE
MR
PEARSON
IN
THE
ROLE
OF
A
POPULAR
ORATOR
AT
THE
HUSTINGS
-
THE
SPELLBINDER
THAT
MR
DIEFEN
BAKER
WAS
IN
THE
LAST
TWO
CAMPAIGNS
-
THE
IMPRESSION
REMAINS
THAT
THE
LIBERAL
LEADER
IS
STILL
THE
DIPLOMATIST
-
MORE
AT
HOME
IN
THE
CHANCERY
-
OR
THE
CORRIDORS
OF
THE
UNITED
NATIONS
-
NOT
THE
FATHER
FIGURE
-
SO
NECESSARY
IN
CANADIAN
LEADERSHIP
-
OR
THE
PRACTICAL
POLITICIAN
-
ABLE
TO
TALK
ABOUT
SEWAGE
PROBLEMS
IN
ALGOMA
EAST
-
STILL
REGARD
HIM
-
AS
SOME
SORT
OF
CROSS
BETWEEN
AN
EGGHEAD
AND
A
MISSIONARY
-
-
HIS
PARTY
ADVISERS
ARE
NOW
TRYING
TO
CORRECT
THAT
IMAGE
-
THE
BOW
TIE
HAS
GONE
-
HE
IS
HAVING
LESSONS
ON
TELEVISION
TECHNIQUES
AND
IS
BEING
COACHED
BY
SPEECH
EXPERTS
-
EVERYTHING
IS
BEING
DONE
TO
PROMOTE
A
NEW
IMAGE
-
CERTAINLY
-
HE
IS
NOW
A
MUCH
LESSLY
TROUNCED
BY
MR
DIEFEN
BAKER
IN
THE
HOUSE
IN
THOSE
EARLY
DAYS
-
IT
HAS
BEEN
A
HARD
ROAD
BACK
AMMUNITION
GIVEN
HIM
BY
THE
GOV
ERNMENT
IN
RECENT
SESSIONS
-
HE
IS
ASSURANCE
AND
IS
A
MATCH
FOR
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
ACROSS
THE
FLOOR
-
SENTENCE
DATABASE
MR
PEARSON
IS
NOW
TALKING
ABOUT
-
HIS
NEW
AND
DYNAMIC
LIBERALISM
-
AND
THIS
WEEK
WILL
-
SHOW
PERHAPS
HOW
FAR
-
MIKE
WILL
GO
-
THE
MAIN
TOPIC
UNDER
REVIEW
IS
COMMITTEES
EXAMINING
SUBJECTS
RANGING
FROM
FOREIGN
INVESTMENT
IN
CANADA
TO
THE
PROBLEMS
OF
THE
ATLANTIC
SENTENCE
DATABASE
MR
THORNEYCROFT
-
THE
MINISTER
OF
AVIATION
-
WHO
ARRIVES
IN
BONN
TOMORROW
FOR
TALKS
WITH
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
ON
A
EUROPEAN
SPACE
SATELLITE
PROJECT
-
WILL
FIND
THE
GERMANS
INTERESTED
IN
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
SPACE
RESEARCH
-
BUT
RATHER
SCEPTICAL
ABOUT
BRITISH
PLANS
FOR
ORGANIZING
IT
-
STATED
MORE
BLUNTLY
-
THEY
ARE
STILL
UNCONVINCED
THAT
SALVE
BLUE
STREAK
-
WHICH
WAS
ABANDONED
LAST
SUMMER
AS
A
MILITARY
PROJECT
-
OR
THAT
THE
EUROPEAN
SPACE
SATELLITE
IS
INDEED
TO
BE
PURELY
SCIENTIFIC
IN
CHARACTER
-
MR
THORNEYCROFTS
MAIN
PURPOSE
WILL
BE
TO
REMOVE
THESE
DOUBTS
-
AND
TO
PERSUADE
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
THAT
THE
FINANCIAL
BURDEN
INVOLVED
IS
REALLY
WORTH
WHILE
-
AT
A
TIME
WHEN
ANY
INCREASE
IN
BUDGETARY
COMMITMENTS
WOULD
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
INVOLVE
A
CORRESPONDING
RISE
IN
TAXATION
-
SOMETHING
NO
ONE
IS
PREPARED
TO
CONTEMPLATE
IN
AN
ELECTION
YEAR
-
BUT
-
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
-
THERE
IS
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
IS
NOT
CONVINCED
-
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
INFORMATION
IT
HAS
SO
FAR
-
THAT
SUCH
A
PROJECT
WOULD
AND
NOT
MERELY
CONSTITUTE
A
-
PRESTIGE
-
SATELLITE
-
DUPLICATING
TO
SOME
EXTENT
AMERICAN
EFFORTS
-
AS
DIE
WELT
SUGGESTS
TODAY
IN
ON
THE
SPECIFIC
QUESTION
OF
THE
USE
OF
BLUE
STREAK
-
MR
THORNEYCROFTS
TASK
WILL
BE
EASIER
-
HE
CAN
POINT
OUT
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
ONLY
ROCKET
AND
LAUNCHER
IN
EUROPE
TO
HAVE
REACHED
A
SUFFICIENT
STAGE
OF
DEVELOPMENT
FOR
ADAPTATION
AS
THE
FIRST
STAGE
IN
PUTTING
A
HEAVY
SATELLITE
INTO
OUTER
SPACE
-
BRITISH
ROCKET
-
BLACK
KNIGHT
-
FOR
THE
SECOND
STAGE
-
BUT
THE
FRENCH
HAVE
ONE
OF
THEIR
OWN
CALLED
VERONIQUE

HOWEVER
-
THAT
THE

TREATY
VARIOUS
ROCKET
STAGES
HAD
ALREADY
BEEN
OF

INVOLVED
-
A
LESSER
OBSTACLE

THE

RESPONSIBLE
FOR
IT

THEREFORE
OF
ANY

VISIT
40
MINUTES
AFTER
MR

HAD
ARRIVED
FROM

-
MR

SAID
HE
HOPED
HIS
WEEKEND
TALKS
WITH
PRESIDENT

WOULD
-
HELP
-
TO
ESTABLISH
AN
ENDURING
PEACE
BETWEEN
NATIONS
-
-
REPLYING
TO
A
FAREWELL
SPEECH
FROM
AUSTRIAN
PRESIDENT
SCHAERF
-
THE
SOVIET
PREMIER
THANKED
AUSTRIA
FOR
THE
HOSPITALITY
AND
WELCOME
HE
HAD
RECEIVED
-
-
THE
SOVIET
UNION
HAS
ALWAYS
STRIVEN
AND
IS
STRIVING
TO
SAFEGUARD
AN
ENDURING
PEACE
FOR
THE
PEOPLES
-
TO
SECURE
AN
EARLY
SOLUTION
OF
THE
MR
GAITSKELL
TODAY
DELIVERED
A
FULLBLOODED
DEFENCE
OF
THE
POLARIS
MISSILE
BASE
-
AND
BY
IMPLICATION
HE
SUPPORTED
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
SITES
IN
BRITAIN
FOR
THE
TRAINING
OF
GERMAN
TROOPS
-
HIS
MAIN
THEME
WAS
THAT
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
WERE
NECESSARY
TO
DEFEND
BRITAIN
-
THAT
BRITAIN
MUST
DEPEND
ON
NATO
AND
-
THE
WEST
-
MUST
HAVE
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
SO
LONG
AS
THE
SOVIET
UNION
HAS
THEM
-
ADDRESSING
THE
ANNUAL
CONGRESS
OF
THE
NATIONAL
UNION
OF
GENERAL
AND
MUNICIPAL
WORKERS
-
HE
SAID
HE
FELT
SURE
THE
LABOUR
MOVEMENT
WAS
COMING
ROUND
IN
SUPPORT
OF
HIS
VIEWS
-
OBVIOUSLY
CONSCIOUS
OF
THE
FIERCE
AND
WIDESPREAD
RESENTMENT
OVER
THE
US
POLARIS
BASE
IN
BRITAIN
-
MR
GAITSKELL
SAID
THAT
HE
EVEN
NOTICED
THAT
SUPPORTERS
OF
UNILATERAL
NUCLEAR
DISARMAMENT
WERE
CHANGING
THEIR
TACTICS
BY
SWITCHING
MOST
OF
THEIR
EMPHASIS
ON
TO
THE
MISSILE
-
MR
GAITSKELL
SAID
THAT
A
MEMBER
OF
AN
ALLIANCE
COULD
NOT
DENY
FACILITIES
TO
NATIONS
TO
WHICH
IT
WAS
ALLIED
-
BUT
GOVERNMENTS
SHOULD
BE
FREE
TO
NEGOTIATE
AND
REFUSE
PROPOSALS
WITH
WHICH
THEY
DID
NOT
AGREE
-
THE
LABOUR
PARTY
OPPOSED
THOR
MISSILES
-
BECAUSE
-
HE
SAID
-
THEY
WERE
OUT
OF
DATE
AND
VULNERABLE
AND
WOULD
ATTRACT
ENEMY
ACTION
-
THAT
ARGUMENT
DID
NOT
APPLY
TO
THE
POLARIS
SUBMARINE
-
SO
LONG
AS
THE
SOVIET
UNION
HAD
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
-
THE
WEST
-
SOMEWHERE
-
MUST
HAVE
THEM
TOO
-
IT
WAS
FAR
BETTER
FOR
A
WEAPON
USED
FOR
RETALIATORY
PURPOSES
TO
BE
UNDER
THE
SEA
RATHER
THAN
ON
LAND
-
THIS
WAS
WHY
THE
LABOUR
PARTY
DID
NOT
THINK
IT
RIGHT
TO
OPPOSE
THE
POLARIS
DEPOT
SHIP
-
THE
PARTY
AGREED
THAT
IT
WAS
UNWISE
TO
LOCATE
THE
BASE
IN
THE
HOLY
LOCH
-
ONLY
30
MILES
FROM
GLASGOW
-
A
CITY
WITH
TWO
MILLION
PEOPLE
-
IT
SHOULD
BE
SITED
IN
A
MORE
REMOTE
AREA
-
MR
GAITSKELL
ADDED
THAT
THE
SCARBOROUGH
CONFERENCE
DECISIONS
DID
NOT
-
IN
HIS
VIEW
-
TRULY
REFLECT
THE
OPINIONS
OF
THE
MAJORITY
SUPPORTERS
IN
THE
COUNTRY
-
MR
GAITSKELL
ADDED
THAT
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
UNILATERALISTS
WAS
NOT
POSSIBLE
-
THOUGH
HE
RESPECTED
THEIR
VIEWS
-
HE
SAW
BY
REPORTS
RECOMMENDING
THE
SUPPORTERS
OF
UNILATERAL
NUCLEAR
DISARMAMENT
TO
SHIFT
THE
EMPHASIS
OF
THEIR
INTERVENTION
AWAY
FROM
STRAIGHT
OPPOSITION
TO
THE
POLARIS
BASE
-
TO
MR
MACMILLAN
-
MR
GAITSKELL
SAID
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
SHOULD
BEGIN
TO
TAKE
SERIOUSLY
THE
DANGER
OF
THE
SPREAD
OF
NUCLEAR
TO
MACMILLAN
THAT
HE
SHOULD
PRESS
-
I
HOPE
WITH
THE
AGREEMENT
OF
KENNEDY
-
IN
TALKS
WITH
THE
SOVIET
UNION
-
FOR
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
IN
CENTRAL
EUROPE
OF
A
ZONE
OF
CONTROLLED
UNION
WOULD
BE
PREPARED
TO
REACH
AN
AGREEMENT
ON
A
ZONE
OF
CONTROLLED
DISARMAMENT
IN
EUROPE
-
MR
GAITSKELL
CONCLUDED
-
DECLARING
THAT
THE
PRESENT
WAS
THE
BEGINNING
OF
A
GREAT
PERIOD
OF
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
THE
PARTY
-
IT
WAS
A
GREAT
CHANCE
THAT
SHOULD
BE
GRASPED
-
INTERUNION
JEALOUSIES
PREVENT
THE
FULFILMENT
OF
A
COMMON
POLICY
FOR
WAGES
AND
OTHER
MAJOR
QUESTIONS
-
MR
JACK
COOPER
THE
GENERAL
COUNCIL
OF
THE
TRADES
UNION
CONGRESS
SHOULD
THEREFORE
CONSIDER
THE
MATTER
-
CONSIDERATION
SHOULD
ALSO
BE
GIVEN
TO
THE
REGROUPING
OF
UNIONS
AND
THE
MODIFICATION
OF
THEIR
STRUCTURES
TO
MEET
THE
GROWING
CONCENTRATION
OF
CAPITAL
-
MR
COOPER
ARGUED
THAT
A
COMMON
INDUSTRIAL
CONTRIBUTION
WAS
URGENT
-
PARTICULARLY
IN
UNIONS
SERVING
WORKERS
IN
THE
SAME
INDUSTRY
-
ALONG
SUGGESTING
THAT
A
TOTAL
TUC
MEMBERSHIP
OF
EIGHT
MILLION
WAS
A
-
POOR
SHOW
-
COMPARED
WITH
SOME
COUNTRIES
-
HE
ARGUED
THAT
THE
POSITION
NEEDED
EXAMINATION
-
BEFORE
PRESIDENT
KENNEDY
MET
MR
MACMILLAN
YESTERDAY
MORNING
HE
WAS
GIVEN
THE
VIEWS
OF
A
WIDE
SECTION
OF
THE
BRITISH
PEOPLE
ABOUT
POLARIS
SUBMARINE
BASES
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
-
AN
OPEN
LETTER
WRITTEN
BY
EARL
RUSSELL
HOPING
THAT
THE
EARL
RUSSELL
-
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
COMMITTEE
OF
100
-
TOLD
KENNEDY
THAT
HE
SHOULD
TAKE
NOTICE
OF
-
THAT
VERY
LARGE
AND
GROWING
SECTION
WHICH
IS
OPPOSED
TO
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
A
POLARIS
BASE
-
WHETHER
AT
HOLY
LOCH
OR
ELSEWHERE
ON
BRITISH
TERRITORY
-
-
HE
POINTED
OUT
THAT
ALREADY
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
PROTESTS
BUT
THAT
-
VERY
MUCH
LARGER
PROTESTS
ARE
TO
BE
EXPECTED
AND
ARE
BEING
PLANNED
-
-
THERE
ARE
THREE
KINDS
OF
REASONS
THAT
JUSTIFY
THE
PROTESTS
AND
THESE
SHOULD
CARRY
WEIGHT
WITH
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
-
EARL
RUSSELL
SUGGESTED
-
-
THE
FIRST
OF
THESE
REASONS
IS
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
PRE
SERVING
THE
HITHERTO
CORDIAL
RELATIONS
BETWEEN
THE
US
AND
GREAT
BRITAIN
-
NOT
ONLY
IN
GOVERNMENT
CIRCLES
-
BUT
IN
PUBLIC
OPINION
-
-
EARL
RUSSELL
SAYS
IT
IS
INEVITABLE
-
THOUGH
PROFOUNDLY
REGRETTABLE
-
THAT
THE
AGITATION
AGAINST
THE
POLARIS
BASE
HAS
GENERATED
SOME
ANTAGONISM
TO
THE
POLICY
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
-
THE
SECOND
REASON
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
DOUBTS
AS
TO
THE
SAFETY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
OF
GREAT
BRITAIN
-
-
IN
THE
TIME
OF
CRISIS
IT
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
THE
BRITISH
AUTHORITIES
TO
EXERCISE
ANY
DEGREE
OF
CONTROL
OVER
THE
ACTION
OF
POLARIS
SUBMARINES
-
-
HE
ARGUES
THAT
THERE
IS
A
DISTINCT
POSSIBILITY
THAT
SO
LONG
AS
THERE
IS
A
POLARIS
BASE
IN
BRITAIN
THE
SOVIET
UNION
MIGHT
RETALIATE
AGAINST
BRITAIN
ALONE
-
-
SUCH
RETALIATION
MIGHT
-
AND
PROBABLY
WOULD
-
DESTROY
THE
WHOLE
POPULATION
OF
BRITAIN
IN
PROVOKING
AMERICAN
RETALIATION
-
EARL
RUSSELL
BELIEVES
-
-
IT
IS
VERY
QUESTIONABLE
WHETHER
BRITISH
MEMBERSHIP
OF
NATO
AND
BRITISH
PERMISSION
OF
AMERICAN
BASES
ON
OUR
TERRITORY
ADD
ANYTHING
TO
THE
STRENGTH
OF
AMERICA
-
WHILE
-
ON
THE
CONTRARY
-
THEY
IMPOSE
UPON
AMERICA
AN
ONEROUS
OBLIGATION
WHICH
IT
MAY
PROVE
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
FULFIL
-
-
THE
THIRD
REASON
IS
THAT
THE
SUPREME
INTEREST
FOR
THE
WHOLE
WORLD
-
EAST
AND
WEST
AND
UNCOMMITTED
NATIONS
-
IS
THE
PREVENTION
OF
NUCLEAR
WAR
-
-
A
RAPIDLY
GROWING
BODY
OF
OPINION
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
BELIEVES
THAT
BRITAIN
COULD
BE
MORE
EFFECTIVE
IN
PREVENTING
A
NUCLEAR
WAR
AS
A
NEUTRAL
BY
HELPING
TO
SUGGEST
AGREEMENTS
WHICH
COULD
BE
ACCEPTED
BY
BOTH
EAST
AND
WEST
-
-
THE
NEXT
WHITE
PAPER
ON
DEFENCE
-
TO
BE
PUBLISHED
IN
MARCH
-
IS
LIKELY
TO
CONTAIN
A
FIVEYEAR
PLAN
FOR
THE
THREE
SERVICES
-
ITS
AIM
WILL
BE
TO
PRODUCE
SUPERBLY
EQUIPPED
-
ALLREGULAR
FORCES
OF
ABOUT
400000
MEN
-
THE
THREE
SERVICES
WOULD
BE
-
INTEGRATED
-
TO
A
GREATER
EXTENT
THAN
EVER
BEFORE
-
SHORT
OF
WEARING
THE
SAME
UNIFORM
-
WHICH
IS
NOT
CONTEMPLATED
-
THE
NAVY
-
ARMY
AND
ROYAL
AIR
FORCE
WOULD
BECOME
-
FOR
PRACTICAL
PURPOSES
-
A
SINGLE
DEFENCE
FORCE
-
THERE
WOULD
BE
COMPLETE
COOPERATION
AT
ALL
LEVELS
IN
TRAINING
AND
OPERATIONS
-
THIS
WOULD
APPLY
ALSO
IN
THE
COMMAND
STRUCTURE
AND
CENTRAL
ADMINISTRATIVE
HAS
BEEN
WORKING
ON
THE
PLAN
FOR
SOME
MONTHS
-
HE
HAS
HAD
NUMEROUS
MEETINGS
WITH
THE
SERVICE
MINISTERS
-
HE
HAS
ALSO
HAD
TALKS
WITH
THE
EARL
OF
HOME
-
FOREIGN
SECRETARY
-
AND
WITH
OTHER
MINISTERS
CONCERNED
WITH
OVERSEAS
ASPECTS
OF
DEFENCE
POLICY
-
DETAILS
OF
THE
SCHEME
ARE
NOW
BEING
WORKED
OUT
BY
THE
CHIEFS
OF
STAFF
-
A
PROCESS
THAT
MAY
TAKE
FOUR
OR
FIVE
MONTHS
-
APPROVAL
-
MR
WATKINSON
REMAINS
CON
VINCED
THAT
THE
POLICY
INITIATED
IN
RETURN
TO
THE
TRADITION
OF
ALLREGULAR
VOLUNTARY
FORCES
-
WITH
THE
LAST
NATIONAL
SERVICEMAN
OUT
OF
UNIFORM
BY
THE
END
OF
1962
-
THE
MINISTER
REGARDS
THE
RECENT
TREND
OF
RECRUITING
FIGURES
AS
ENCOURAGING
-
HE
IS
CONFIDENT
THE
AIM
CAN
BE
ACHIEVED
-
WHILE
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
AN
EVENTUAL
RETURN
TO
NATIONAL
SERVICE
IN
SOME
FORM
CANNOT
BE
ENTIRELY
DISCOUNTED
-
HE
DOES
NOT
AGREE
THAT
THE
POINT
HAS
BEEN
REACHED
NATIONAL
SERVICE
IS
EVER
RESORTED
TO
-
ENGAGEMENT
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
TO
BE
FOR
THREE
YEARS
-
IT
IS
THOUGHT
THIS
WOULD
BE
THE
MINIMUM
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
EXTENDED
TRAINING
MODERN
ARMS
REQUIRE
AND
TO
ENABLE
EACH
MAN
TO
SERVE
AT
LEAST
A
YEAR
OVERSEAS
-
THERE
IS
NO
TRUTH
IN
SUGGESTIONS
THAT
MR
WATKINSON
IS
AT
ODDS
WITH
THE
SERVICE
CHIEFS
OVER
THE
DECISION
TO
DISPENSE
WITH
NATIONAL
SERVICE
-
OR
OVER
ANY
OTHER
ASPECT
OF
DEFENCE
POLICY
-
CRITICISMS
ABOUT
ARMY
MANPOWER
APPEAR
TO
HAVE
COME
MAINLY
FROM
RETIRED
OFFICERS
ARE
OUT
OF
TOUCH
WITH
THE
EXISTING
SITUATION
-
MR
WATKINSON
HAS
HAD
THE
UTMOST
SUPPORT
FROM
THE
CIGS
-
FIELDMARSHAL
SIR
FRANCIS
FESTING
-
WHO
BELIEVES
COMPLETELY
IN
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
AN
ALLREGULAR
ARMY
-
GEN
SIR
RICHARD
HULL
-
WHO
IS
TO
SUCCEED
SIR
FRANCIS
-
IS
EQUALLY
CONVINCED
MR
WATKINSON
IS
RIGHT
-
SIR
FRANCIS
IS
TO
HAND
OVER
TO
SIR
RICHARD
AS
FROM
NOV
1
-
THE
HANDOVER
-
DUE
IN
SEPTEMBER
-
WAS
DELAYED
BECAUSE
OF
THE
BERLIN
CRISIS
-
MR
WATKINSON
AND
HIS
ADVISERS
FELT
THE
CHANGE
WOULD
BE
UNWISE
AT
A
MOMENT
-
WHEN
ATTENTION
HAD
TO
BE
CONCENTRATED
ON
POSSIBLE
NEED
FOR
IMPORTANT
MILITARY
OPERATIONS
-
FOR
THIS
REASON
SIR
FRANCIS
STAYED
ON

AND
-
SACRIFICED
HIS
LEAVE
-
TOWARDS
THE
NATIONALIST
PARTY
OF
DR
VERWOERD
-
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
-
THIS
IMPLIES
THE
DIS
APPEARANCE
OF
THE
PROGRESSIVE
PARTY
FROM
GENERAL
ELECTION
SHOWED
NATIONALISTS
BEING
RETURNED
IN
THEIR
STRONGHOLDS
-
LIKE

-
WITH
SLIGHTLY
INCREASED
MAJORITIES
-
IN
THE

-

SIR

VILLIERS
GRAAFF
-
HAVE
BEEN
RETURNED
UNOPPOSED

THE

WERE
FOR

SEATS
AS
70
NATIONALISTS
AND
20
UNITED

CANDI
DATES
ARE
UNOPPOSED
-
LONG
BEFORE
POLLING
CLOSED
AT
8
PM
IT
WAS
EVIDENT
THAT
VOTERS
WERE
BORED
BY
THE
GOVERNMENTS
FREQUENT
APPEALS
TO
THE
ELECTORATE
-
THE
ELECTION
WAS
THE
FOURTH
IN
FOUR
YEARS
-
IN
MOST
CONSTITUENCIES
IT
MAY
GO
DOWN
AS
THE
MOST
APATHETIC
IN
THE
COUNTRYS
HISTORY
-
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
DISCLOSED
IN
THE
COMMONS
LAST
NIGHT
THAT
HE
HAD
CONSIDERED
EARLY
IN
THE
PARLIAMENTARY
RECESS
WHETHER
TO
MOBILISE
RESERVES
NECESSARY
TO
BRING
THE
BRITISH
ARMY
OF
THE
RHINE
ON
TO
A
WAR
FOOTING
-
HE
DECIDED
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
A
GREAT
ERROR
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
HESITATION
IN
MOBILISING
IF
A
FURTHER
DETERIORATION
IN
THE
SITUATION
WARRANTED
SUCH
A
STEP
-
IT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
ACCOMPANIED
BY
OTHER
MEASURES
OF
A
MILITARY
-
ECONOMIC
AND
POLITICAL
KIND
-
MR
MACMILLAN
-
WHO
WAS
WINDING
UP
THE
FOREIGN
AFFAIRS
DEBATE
-
SAID
THE
GOVERNMENT
COULD
NOT
BE
PARTY
TO
ACCEPTING
AS
A
MATTER
OF
PRINCIPLE
THE
IMPOSED
DIVISION
OF
GERMANY
-
-
WE
MUST
NOT
BE
RATTLED
INTO
SURRENDER
-
BUT
WE
MUST
NOT
-
AND
I
AM
NOT
-
BE
AFRAID
OF
NEGOTIATION
-
-
MR
GODBER
-
MINISTER
OF
STATE
-
FOREIGN
OFFICE
-
SAID
EARLIER
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAD
ASKED
THE
MEDICAL
RESEARCH
COUNCIL
TO
REASSESS
THE
FALLOUT
POSITION
IN
VIEW
OF
THE
RUSSIAN
TESTS
-
THE
COUNCILS
FINDINGS
WOULD
BE
MADE
PUBLIC
-
WITH
A
VIGOUR
AND
AUTHORITY
WHICH
DELIGHTED
THE
EARL
OF
AVON
-
THE
FORMER
SIR
ANTHONY
THAT
-
APPEASEMENT
OVER
BERLIN
COULD
ONLY
LEAD
TO
WAR
-
TO
STAND
FIRM
-
HE
THE
SUREST
WAY
TO
AVERT
IT
-
IT
WAS
THE
END
OF
A
RATHER
CURIOUS
SPEECH
IN
WHICH
MR
MACMILLAN
WOUND
UP
THE
TWODAY
DEBATE
ON
FOREIGN
AFFAIRS
-
HE
BEGAN
IN
A
LOW
-
ALMOST
CHATTY
MONO
TONE
-
AND
HIS
VOICE
NEVER
ROSE
TO
ANY
ACCENT
OF
URGENCY
-
HE
PASSED
IN
RAPID
NUCLEAR
TESTS
-
THE
CANARD
ABOUT
BRITISH
INTERFERENCE
WITH
THE
UNITED
NATIONS
IN
THE
CONGO
-
KUWAIT
-
AND
SOUTHEAST
ASIA
-
HE
SPENT
MOST
OF
HIS
SHORT
HALFHOUR
ON
BERLIN
-
HE
DEPLORED
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
SOME
-
NEW
MYTH
-
ABOUT
BETRAYAL
OF
GERMANY
KNOW
WHAT
THE
RUSSIANS
WANT
-
-
BUT
HE
WAS
CERTAIN
THAT
THEY
WANTED
TO
ESTABLISH
A
FINAL
AND
IRREVOCABLE
DIVISION
OF
GERMANY
-
BRITAIN
COULD
NOT
BE
A
PARTY
TO
AN
IMPOSED
DIVISION
-
BUT
NEGOTIATION
-
AS
THE
DEBATE
HAD
SHOWN
-
COULD
BE
UNDERTAKEN
ON
A
VARIETY
MR
MACMILLAN
EXPLAINED
THAT
HE
HAD
DELIBER
ATELY
REFRAINED
DURING
THE
SUMMER
FROM
RECALLING
PARLIAMENT
OR
ORDERING
MOBILISATION
BY
PROCLAMATION
-
SUCH
AS
WOULD
BE
ON
TO
A
FULLY
ACTIVE
FOOTING
-
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
CREATED
A
THOROUGHLY
UNDE
SIRABLE
ATMOSPHERE
OF
PANIC
-
HE
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
SITUATION
WAS
RATHER
MORE
HOPEFUL
-
THE
RUSSIANS
NOW
REALISED
ITS
SERIOUSNESS
-
THE
FRENCH
DOUBTS
WERE
MORE
ABOUT
PROCEDURE
THAN
ABOUT
SUBSTANCE
-
THE
PRIME
MINISTERS
ATTITUDE
OF
STUDIED
CALM
BROUGHT
DOWN
THE
TEMPERATURE
OF
THE
DEBATE
-
WHICH
NEVER
AT
ANY
TIME
ROSE
TO
FEVER
PITCH
-
TO
A
REMARKABLE
DEGREE
OF
SUBNORMALITY
-
THROUGHOUT
MR
MACMILLANS
SPEECH
THE
EARL
OF

THE
PEERS

THE
EARLY
SPEAKERS
IN
THE
DEBATE
EACH
SEVERELY
RATED
THE
SPEECH
OF
HIS
PREDECESSOR
-
THESE
STRICTURES
WERE
ALL
TOO
WELL
JUSTIFIED
-
WE
STARTED
WITH
THE
PLAINTIVE
WAILINGS
OF
MR
HEALEY
-
-

-
FOREIGN

DESCRIBED
BY
MR

CENSURED
BY
MR

-
FORMER
LABOUR
DEFENCE
MINISTER
-
FOR
HAVING
READ
THE
THE
TROUBLE
ABOUT
SUCH
DEBATES
IS
THAT
THEY
RANGE
TOO
WIDELY
-
THEY
REMIND
ONE
OF
THE
RUGBY
MATCH
IN
-
TOM
BROWNS
SCHOOLDAYS
-
-
IN
WHICH
ALL
THE
BOYS
WERE
WELCOME
TO
TAKE

AND
ONLY
THOSE
WHO

REALLY
MEANT

REMOVED
THEIR

NOT

MR

LAUNCHED
OUT
ON

THIS
COULD

HE
SUGGESTED

BE
LINKED
WITH
PROHIBITION
OF
THE
PRODUCTION
OF
ATOMIC
WEAPONS
IN
ANY
PART
OF

BE
MUCH
EASIER

NO

TO
TAKE
UP
MORAL
ATTITUDES

-
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
THE

THE

MR

ATTACK
WAS
UNPRECEDENTED

HE
ACCUSED
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
OF
-
POLITICAL
DOUBLE
TALK

IT
HAD
THE
EFFECT
ON
ONE
FORMER
SUPPORTER
THAT
HE
NOW
THINKS
THIS
PRIME
MINISTER
IS
A
NATIONAL
DISASTER
-
-
HE
SAID
-
ANYTHING
-
RALLIED
SUPPORT
TO
THE

-
THIS
APPARENTLY
-
WAS
MR
MACMILLANS
ASSESSMENT

HE
CONFINED
HIS

HAD
PROBABLY

MAXIMISED
HIS

THERE
WERE
NO

WILL

AND
EARNEST

HER

COME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
IT
WOULD

FOR

DEALT
WITH
THE
MAIN

RAISED
BY

MR

THE

WOULD

AS
WE
WAIT
FOR

TO

ON
THE

CONFERENCE
IN

-
WILL
IT
END
WITH
SOUTH
AFRICAS
EXCLUSION
FROM

-
THE
ISSUE
IS
TOUCH
AND
GO
-
THERE
IS
A
POSSIBILITY
THAT
IT
WILL

AT

-
IT
MAY
BE
AGREED
TO

UNTIL
SOUTH

ACTUALLY
BECOMES
A

IN

-
BUT
IF
A
FINAL
DECISION
IS
TO
BE
FACED
NOW
-
ON
WHICH
SIDE
DO
THE
STRONGEST
ARGUMENTS
LIE
-
THE
ARCHBISHOP
OF
CAPETOWN
HAS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
MATTER
IS
NOT
CLEARCUT
-
THE
ARCHBISHOP
HAS
LONG
BEEN
A
COURAGEOUS
FIGHTER
AGAINST
APARTHEID
-
HE
MUST
BE
HEARD
WITH
ATTENTION
-
ON
PURELY
PRACTICAL
GROUNDS
HE
HOLDS
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
A
MISTAKE
TO
EXPEL
SOUTH
AFRICA
-
WEAKENING
THE
WHITES
WHO
ARE
WORKING
FOR
A
CHANGE
OF
POLICY
-
IN
HIS
VIEW
IT
WOULD
ALSO
BE
AGAINST
THE
INTERESTS
OF
THE
AFRICANS
-
HE
HOLDS
THAT
MORE
PRESSURE
CAN
BE
PUT
ON
SOUTH
AFRICA
WHILE
SHE
REMAINS
IN
THE
COMMONWEALTH
THAN
COULD
BE
EXERCISED
WERE
SHE
CUT
OFF
FROM
IT
-
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
-
THOSE
WHO
FAVOUR
EXPULSION
-
INCLU
DING
AFRICAN
LEADERS
-
FEEL
THAT
NOTHING
LESS
THAN
THE
SHOCK
OF
EXPULSION
WILL
WEAKEN
THE
GRIP
OF
DR
THE
APARTHEID
POLICY
-
THE
COMMONWEALTH
IS
A
MULTIRACIAL
SOCIETY
-
A
POLICY
OF
RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION
IN
ANY
OF
ITS
COUNTRIES
WHATEVER
STATESMEN
SAY
AT
THE
CONFERENCE
TABLE
IN
LONDON
-
MILLIONS
AT
HOME
WOULD
REGARD
AS
FRAUDULENT
A
COMMONWEALTH
WHICH
HAD
ROOM
FOR
A
RACIST
SOUTH
AFRICA
-
AND
THIS
IS
A
COMMONWEALTH
IN
WHICH
FIVE
CITIZENS
ARE
COLOURED
FOR
EVERY
ONE
WHO
IS
WHITE
-
SEEN
IN
THIS
WIDER
PICTURE
-
A
SOUTH
AFRICA
THAT
CLINGS
TO
APARTHEID
IS
A
MENACE
TO
THE
COMMONWEALTH
AND
A
LIABILITY
TO
THE
WHOLE
WESTERN
WORLD
-
A
PRACTICAL
SOLUTION
WOULD
BE
FOR
THE
COMMONWEALTH
TO
DRAFT
A
SET
OF
PRINCIPLES
EXCLUDING
RACE
DISCRIMINATION
-
AND
SO
LEAVE
SOUTH
AFRICA
TO
MAKE
THE
GRADE
-
OR
GO
OUT
-
THE
QUEEN
AND
THE
DUKE
OF
EDINBURGH
COME
HOME
TONIGHT
FROM
THEIR
TOUR
IN
THE
EAST
-
THE
DUKES
HAVE
TAKEN
THE
HEADLINES
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
-
NEVERTHELESS
-
THE
TOUR
HAS
BEEN
AN
IMMENSE
SUCCESS
-
THE
QUEEN
HAS
WON
A
TRIUMPH
-
IT
WOULD
BE
PLEASANTER
IF
SUCH
CRUEL
AND
FEUDAL
PERFORMANCES
AS
TIGER
AND
RHINO
HUNTS
WERE
DROPPED
FROM
FUTURE
ROYAL
PROGRAMMES
-
BUT
THE
QUEEN
AND
THE
DUKE
HAVE
PLEASED
MILLIONS
BY
THEIR
VISIT
-
THE
WARMTH
OF
THEIR
WELCOME
IN
INDIA
AND
PAKISTAN
ARE
HAPPY
MEMORIES
-
WEST
GERMANY
-
FOLLOWED
YESTERDAY
BY
THE
DUTCH
-
HAS
MADE
THE
GESTURE
OF
A
GOOD
NEIGHBOUR
-
SHE
HAS
PUT
UP
THE
VALUE
OF
HER
MONEY
-
CERTAINLY
-
THE
RISE
IS
VERY
SMALL
-
BUT
IT
IS
A
STEP
WILL
NOW
GROW
BRIGHTER
OF
FURTHER
INTERNATIONAL
COOPERATION
-
WHICH
IS
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
SOLVE
THE
PAYMENTS
DIFFICULTIES
THAT
UPSET
THE
WESTERN
WORLD
-
BRITAIN
AND
THE
US
-
WHICH
HAVE
PROBLEMS
WITH
THEIR
BALANCES
-
WILL
GAIN
SOME
IMMEDIATE
HELP
-
WHAT
IT
MEANS
IN
PRACTICAL
TERMS
IS
THAT
OUR
EXPORTS
TO
GERMANY
WILL
NOW
BE
A
LITTLE
CHEAPER
FOR
GERMANS
TO
BUY
-
WHILE
THE
GOODS
WHICH
GERMANY
EXPORTS
WILL
BE
MADE
A
LITTLE
DEARER
-
BOOMING
GERMANY
IS
DELIBERATELY
ENCOURAGING
MORE
IMPORTS
AS
A
MEANS
TO
CURB
RISING
PRICES
AT
HOME
-
SHE
IS
ALSO
AWARE
HOW
-
UNPOPULAR
SHE
HAS
BEEN
GROWING
BY
FAILING
UNTIL
NOW
TO
COOPERATE
AS
A
CREDITOR
NATION
SHOULD
-
GERMANY
EXPORTS
MUCH
MORE
THAN
SHE
IMPORTS
-
FOR
UPWARDS
OF
FIVE
YEARS
THE
WORLDS
RESERVES
OF
DOLLARS
HAVE
BEEN
DRAINED
INTO
GERMANY
-
THERE
THEY
HAVE
STAYED
USELESSLY
LOCKED
UP
BECAUSE
GERMANY
HAS
NO
TRADITION
OF
TRADING
ABROAD
-
IN
ADDITION
THE
STRENGTH
OF
GERMANYS
TRADING
POSITION
HAS
ATTRACTED
SPECULATORS
TO
HOLD
MARKS
RATHER
THAN
POUNDS
OR
DOLLARS
-
WILL
THE
NEW
VALUATION
BE
ENOUGH
TO
CORRECT
OFF
SPECULATION
AGAINST
DOLLAR
AND
POUND
-
SHARE
IN
GIVING
AID
TO
UNDERDEVELOPED
NATIONS
-
THE
TO
OPTIMISM
IS
THE
SIGN
THAT
GERMANY
AND
THE
OTHER
LEADING
WESTERN
NATIONS
ARE
AT
LONG
LAST
MOVING
TOWARDS
A
SOLUTION
OF
CURRENCY

BY

THIS
IS
A

IT
WOULD
OBVIOUSLY
BE

TO

WHOSE

THE

RIGHT
TO
EXERCISE
EDITORIAL
DISCRETION
-
THE

ADVERTISEMENT
FALLS
INTO
NEITHER
CATEGORY
-
THOUGH
MANY
READERS
WILL
DISLIKE
IT
-
THE
FIRST
REACTION
OF
THE
SUDANESE
GOVERNMENT
WAS
TO
DENOUNCE
THE
UNITED
TO
SAY
THAT
ITS
400
TROOPS
IN
THE
CONGO
WOULD
BE
TAKEN
HOME
-
THE
REACTION
CAN
BE
UNDERSTOOD
-
THE
SUDANS
CONCERN
FOR
ITS
MEN
IS
NATURAL
-
BUT
THIS
COULD
HARDLY
BE
A
-
DIGNIFIED
EXIT
-
IF
THE
UN
IS
BLAMED
FOR
BEING
WEAK
-
IT
WOULD
BE
MORE
LOGICAL
TO
SEND
IN
MORE
MEN
-
NOT
WEAKEN
IT
FURTHER
BY
DESERTION
-
IT
IS
UNJUST
TO
PASS
THE
BUCK
TO
MR
HAMMARSKJOLD
AND
THE
UNS
SERVANTS
-
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
RIGHTLY
BELONGS
TO
THE
NATIONS
WHICH
HAVE
UNDERTAKEN
THE
TASK
OF
PRE
SERVING
PEACE
IN
THE
CONGO
-
THAT
IS
NOT
A
CEREMONIAL
DUTY
-
AND
THE

HAVE
EVERY
RIGHT
TO
BLAME
THE
POLITICIANS
UNLESS
THEY
SEE
IT
THROUGH

WHEN
THE
UNITED

INSTRUCTED
MR
HAMMARSKJOLD
TO
USE
FORCE
IF
NECESSARY
TO
PREVENT
CIVIL
WAR
-
IT
WAS
CLEAR
THAT

WOULD

UNLESS
IT
GAVE

THE
POLITICAL
-
THAT
WAS
THE

POINT
THAT

3000
MEN
-
WHO
MUST
TAKE
ABOUT
A
FORTNIGHT
TO
ARRIVE
-
IF
THE
UN
FORCES
WERE
THICK
ENOUGH
ON
THE
GROUND
-
HAPPEN
-
THE
UNS
ABILITY
TO
KEEP
PEACE
DEPENDS
SIMPLY
ON
ADEQUATE
SUPPORT
BY
THE
NATIONS
WHICH
HAVE
SET
THEIR
HANDS
TO
THIS
PLOUGH
-
THE
BIG
POWERS
INVOLVED
IN
THE
COLD
WAR
MUST
OF
COURSE
KEEP
OUT
-
THE
AMERICANS
WERE
JUSTIFIED
IN
DIVERTING
NAVAL
SHIPS
IN
CASE
STRESSED
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
INTENTION
TO
INTERVENE
IN
FIGHTING
-
YESTERDAY
THE
SHIPS
TURNED
AWAY
IT
IS
TO
BE
HOPED
THAT
THE
UN
WILL
BE
REESTABLISHED
IN
THEIR
PORT
BY
NEGOTIATION
AND
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
NO
MORE
OUTRAGES
-
THEY
MUST
GO
-
THE
BEST
NEWS
FOR
THE
CONGO
WOULD
BE
AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
ITS
RIVAL
POLITICAL
LEADERS
-
THROUGH
THE
PATIENT
EFFORTS
OF
UN
CONCILIATORS
THEY
ARE
MEETING
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
-
IN
MALAGASY
-
FORMERLY
RELIEF
WHEN
THIS
STRIFETORN
LAND
GETS
ITSELF
A
GOVERNMENT
WHICH
ALL
OUTSIDERS
CAN
RECOGNISE
-
ONLY
A
MAN
WRAPPED
IN
THE
IMPENETRABLE
COCOON
OF
WHAT
HE
REGARDS
AS
A
DIVINE
MISSION
COULD
HAVE
SPOKEN
OF
APARTHEID
AS
-
A
POLICY
OF
GOOD
NEIGHBOURLINESS
-
-
WE
MAY
BE
SURE
THAT
HE
IS
NOT
BEING
HYPOCRITICAL
-
THAT
IS
WHAT
HE
REALLY
BELIEVES
-
A
GOOD
NEIGHBOUR
TO
THOSE
AFRICANS
WHO
-
UNDER
APARTHEID
-
WILL
BE
FORCED
BACK
TO
THEIR
TRIBAL
RESERVES
WITH
NO
PROSPECT
BUT
A
CRAMPED
AND
PRIMITIVE
EXISTENCE
-
A
GOOD
NEIGHBOUR
TO
THOSE
AFRICANS
WHO
WILL
CON
TINUE
TO
LIVE
AS
HEWERS
OF
WOOD
AND
DRAWERS
OF
WATER
IN
THE
WHITE
AREAS
OF
SOUTH
AFRICA
-
WITHOUT
RIGHTS
AND
WITHOUT
HOPE
-
THE
SAME
SORT
OF
GOOD
NEIGHBOUR
THAT
HE
PROVED
TO
BE
TO
THE
JEWS
FLEEING
FROM
HITLER
IN
THE
THIRTIES
-
IT
WAS
DR
VERWOERD
WHO
LED
A
PROTEST
AGAINST
ADMITTING
ANY
OF
THEM
BECAUSE
THEY
WOULD
-
DEFILE
-
THE
NATIONAL
WHITE
STOCK
-
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
MAKE
CONTACT
WITH
DR
VER
WOERD
IN
HIS
NIGHTMARE
WORLD
-
IT
IS
THIS
THAT
MAKES
ILLUSORY
ANY
HOPES
THAT

MAY
BE
IN
FLUENCED
TO
CHANGE
COURSE
-
THE
ARCHBISHOP
OF
CAPETOWN
-
DR
JOOST
DE
BLANK
-
HAS
PLEADED
THAT
SOUTH

SHOULD
BE
ALLOWED
TO
STAY
IN
THE
COMMONWEALTH
-
OTHERWISE
-
HE
SAYS
-
THOSE
INSIDE
THE
COUNTRY
WHO
STILL
OPPOSE
APARTHEID
WILL
BE
LEFT
EVEN
MORE
ISOLATED
AND
ALONE
-
MAINTAINED
AN
UNFLINCHING
WITNESS
TO
WHAT

MEANS

MUST
CARRY

WHAT

IN

-
CAN
THE
OTHER

COUNTRIES
DO
TO
BRING
SUPPORT
AND
COMFORT
TO
THIS
GALLANT
MINORITY
-
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
POLICY
OF
APPEASEMENT
HAS
MODIFIED
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
NATIONALISTS
-
ON
THE
CONTRARY
-
APARTHEID
IS
BEING
APPLIED
EVER
MORE
RUTHLESSLY
-
THE
SHOCK
OF
EXPULSION
FROM
THE
WAY
LEFT
TO
TRY
TO
BRING
HOME
TO
THE
PEOPLE
OF
SOUTH
AFRICA
THAT
DR
VERWOERD
IS
LEADING
THEM
TO
DISASTER
-
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
THE
COMMONWEALTH
PRIME
MINISTERS
WILL
DECIDE
AGAINST
THIS
FINAL
STEP
-
IF
THAT
IS
THEIR
DECISION
THEY
SHOULD
ALSO
GO
UNEQUIVOCALLY
ON

THAT
THEY
REGARD
APARTHEID
AS
EVIL
AND
INDEFENSIBLE
-
BE
ABLE
TO
RETURN

CLAIMING
A

-
HIS

ARE

WHEN

DUKE
OF

WILL
MARRY
MISS
WORSLEY

HARDLY

ADVOCATE
PUTTING
OFF
ANY
APPROACH
UNTIL
MR
KRUSHCHEV
GIVES
EVIDENCE
OF

OF

-
WHATEVER
THAT
MAY

WOULD
HAVE
US
RUN

GREATER
THAN
THE
WEST
OUGHT
TO
RUN
-
AND
GREATER
THAN
PRESIDENT

MOST
INFLUENTIAL
ADVISERS
SEEM
DISPOSED
TO

-
THE
REAL
QUESTION
IS
GOVERNMENT
AS
A
BASIS
FOR
TALKS
-
AND
ON
THIS
READING
WHAT
MR
GOLLANCZ
CALLS
MANOEUVRING
-
AND
WHAT
WE
SHOULD
CALL
A
MEANS
NOT
TO
DESTRUCTION
BUT
TO
SAFETY
-
THE
GOVERNMENTS
POMPOUS
LITTLE
STATEMENT
ON
NORTHERN
RHODESIA
DOES
NOT
SAY
MUCH
-
BUT
IT
SAYS
WHAT
IS
NECESSARY
-
THAT
THE
NORTHERN
RHODESIA
CONSTITUTION
IS
MUCH
THE
GOVERNMENT
TRIES
TO
DISGUISE
IT
BY
SAYING
THAT
THE
REVISION
WOULD
BE
FORMULA

WHICH
APPEARED
IN
FEBRUARY
-
APPEARED
TO
MAKE
THIS
LIKELY
-
FORMULA
TWO
-
WHICH
APPEARED
IN

-
MADE
IT
VERY
UNLIKELY
-
IF
FORMULA
THREE
RESTORES
THE
ORIGINAL
PRINCIPLE
-
THAT
IS
ALL
THAT
NEED
BE
REQUIRED
OF
IT
-
IT
IS
A
PITY
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
EVER
HAVE
BEEN
LED
AWAY
FROM
THIS
PRINCIPLE
-
IT
IS
A
GREAT
PITY
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
GIVE
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
RESPONDING
-
NOT
TO
MR
KAUNDAS
REASONABLE
REPRESENTATIONS

BUT
TO
THE
VIOLENCE
WHICH
HE
TRIED
TO

TO
BE
ABLE
TO

WE
MUST
NOT

OVERCONFIDENT
THAT
THIS

NOT

THERE
CAN
SELDOM
HAVE
BEEN
AN

WANTED
TO

WESTERN

THE

HAS
BEEN
A

WEIGHING
DOWN
AND
ALMOST
PARALYSING
THEIR

TO

OUT
SENSIBLE
WAYS
OF

WITH
THE

CRISIS
-
IT
NEED
NOT

A

NOTHING
TO

THEY
WERE
SO
CONVINCED

THEY

TO

THE
CONSEQUENCES

WHILE
IN

ITSELF
THE
COURSE
OF
THE

HAS
DISMAYED
A
GOOD
MANY
PEOPLE

THEY
TOO
WILL
BE

WHEN

BUT
DISCUSSION
ON

COULD
NOT

THE

THAT

WHAT

IT

AN

IS
TO
MAKE
RELIGIOUS
CON
TACT
ACROSS
THE
GREATEST
POLITICAL
BARRIER
IN
WHAT
IS
NOT
YET
A
UNITARY
WORLD
-
THE
NOTIFICATION
HE
ENVISAGES
MUST
BE
GIVEN
AT
LEAST
TWO
DAYS
BEFORE
THE
AGREEMENT
IS
SIGNED
-
TO
THIS
THERE
WILL
BE
SOME
OPPOSITION
-
THE
BILL
IS
SHORT
AND
MODEST
IN
SCOPE
-
AND
IT
IS
DOUBTFUL
WHETHER
THE
OTHER
PRIVATE
MEMBERS
BILLS
IN
THE
OFFING
WILL
FILL
ALL
THE
GAPS
-
THIS
FACT
MAY
GIVE
THE
GOVERNMENT
AN
EXTRA
EXCUSE
FOR
COUNSELLING
PATIENCE
UNTIL
THE
NEXT
REPORT
FROM
THE
MOLONY
COMMITTEE
-
COMPREHENSIVE
LEGISLATION
IS
OBVIOUSLY
PREFERABLE
-
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
-
HOWEVER
-
DISDAIN
THIS
OPPORTUNITY
OF
OBTAINING
A
USEFUL
SAMPLE
OF
PARLIAMENTARY
OPINION
BY
AT
LEAST
ALLOWING
THESE
BILLS
A
FAIR
RUN
-
CENTIGRADE
V
FAHRENHEIT
-
THE
FIGHT
IS
ON
-
THE
CHALLENGER
HAS
BEHIND
IT
NOT
ONLY
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
THE
SECRETARY
OF
STATE
FOR
AIR
BUT
ALSO
THE
BACKING
OF
THE
DIRECTOR
GENERAL
OF
THE
METEORO
LOGICAL
OFFICE
-
THE
PRESS
AND
THE
BROADCASTING
AUTHORITIES
ARE
ASKED
TO
HELP
-
TO
BEGIN
WITH
-
BOTH
TEMPE
RATURES
WILL
BE
PUT
IN
THE
RING
TOGETHER
-
SIR
GRAHAM
SUTTON
-
HOWEVER
-
MADE
NO
BONES
ABOUT
IT
YESTERDAY
-
THE
PURPOSE
IS
TO
GIVE
FAHRENHEIT
THE
KNOCK
OUT
-
THE
BACKERS
OF
CENTIGRADE
WOULD
HAVE
GOT
OFF
TO
A
BETTER
START
IF
THEY
HAD
TAKEN
MORE
PAINS
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
ADVANTAGES
TO
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
OF
THE
CHANGE
-
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
SIR
GRAHAM
SAID
THERE
IS
AT
THE
MOMENT
-
AN
AWFUL
MESS
UP
-
IN
THE
MEASUREMENT
OF
TEMPERATURES
-
THIS
-
HOWEVER
-
SEEMS
A
MATTER
OF
THE
CONVENIENCE
OF
SPECIALISTS
-
THE
ORDINARY
BRITISH
MAN
AND
WOMAN
IS
CONSCIOUS
OF
NO
DIFFICULTY
-
RATHER
THAN
FIFTY
MILLION
PEOPLE
HAVING
TO
BE
PUT
OUT
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
50000
IS
THERE
ANY
REASON
WHY
THE
CENTIGRADE
COUNTRIES
SHOULD
NOT
CHANGE
TO
FAHRENHEIT
-
CAN
IT
BE
SHOWN
THAT
THE
ONE
SCALE
IS
DEMON
EVEN
THEN
IT
MIGHT
BE
EASIER
TO
PERSUADE
THE
BRITISH
PUBLIC
TO
GO
OVER
TO
DECIMAL
COINAGE
-
IN
CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES
THE
TIME
WOULD
COME
WHEN
THIS
WOULD
SUIT
THEIR
CONVENIENCE
-
RATHER
THAN
TO
CHANGE
THEIR
SYSTEM
OF
RECORDING
TEMPERATURES
-
IN
ANY
CASE
-
FAHRENHEIT
NEED
NOT
LOSE
HEART
-
ONCE
BEFORE
-
AND
THAT
NOT
SO
LONG
AGO
-
THE
AUTHORITIES
GANGED
UP
TO
ALTER
THE
HABITS
OF
PEOPLE
-
THAT
EFFORT
WAS
TO
ENFORCE
THE
ADOPTION
OF
THE
TWENTYFOUR
HOUR
CLOCK
-
THEN
-
ALSO
-
THE
BBC
WERE
ROPED
IN
-
THE
ONLY
RESULT
WAS
THAT
THE
WELLMEANING
CORPORATION
BECAME
VERY
UNPOPULAR
-
A
BAFFLED
AND
BEWILDERED
LITTLE
COUNTRY
STANDS
AT
THE
CENTRE
OF
AN
INTERNATIONAL
STORM
-
BELGIUM
IS
ACCUSED
-
WITHOUT
A
SCRAP
OF
EVIDENCE
-
OF
BEING
IMPLICATED
IN
THE
MURDER
OF
PATRICE
LUMUMBA
-
HER
LEADERS
ARE
INSULTED
-
HER
EMBASSIES
ARE
ATTACKED
IN
A
SCORE
OF
COUNTRIES
-
IN
GHANA
-
PRESIDENT
NKRUMAH
-
WHO
HAS
DONE
MORE
THAN
MOST
TO
STIR
UP
TROUBLE
IN
THE
CONGO
-
ORDERS
EVERY
BELGIAN
CITIZEN
TO
QUIT
HIS
COUNTRY
-
HOUNDING
BELGIUM
HAS
BECOME
AN
INTERNATIONAL
PASTIME
-
WHY
-
BECAUSE
THOSE
WHO
SAID
THE
CONGOLESE
COULD
GOVERN
THEMSELVES
WILL
NOT
ADMIT
THEY
WERE
WRONG
-
SO
BELGIUM
-
BOWED
DOWN
BY
INTERNAL
TROUBLES
-
MOURNING
A
TERRIBLE
AIR
CRASH
-
IS
MADE
THEIR
SCAPEGOAT
-
WHO
WILL
SPEAK
FOR
BELGIUM
-
WHO
ELSE
BUT
BRITAIN
-
WE
HAVE
FOUGHT
BESIDE
BELGIUM
IN
TWO
WORLD
WARS
-
WE
ARE
ALLIES
STILL
-
BRITAIN
SHOULD
CHAMPION
BELGIUM
-
NOT
WITH
THE
CAREFUL
-
HOODED
LANGUAGE
OF
DIPLOMACY
-
BUT
BOLDLY
AND
FEARLESSLY
-
IT
IS
TIME
TO
SHOW
THE
WORLD
THAT
THIS
COUNTRY
DOES
NOT
DESERT
HER
FRIENDS
-
HAPPY
-
HAPPY
FAMILIES
-
NEVER
BEFORE
HAVE
BRITAINS
LARDERS
BEEN
SO
WELL
STOCKED
-
SUPPLIES
OF
MEAT
AND
DAIRY
PRODUCE
WERE
SUBSTANTIALLY
HIGHER
LAST
YEAR
THAN
IN
1959
-
LUCKY
-
LUCKY
HOUSEWIVES
-
TO
HAVE
SUCH
A
SPLENDID
VARIETY
OF
GOODS
TO
CHOOSE
FROM
-
NOT
SO
LONG
AGO
OLDER
FOLK
WERE
REMINDING
YOUNG
WIVES
-
-
HARASSED
BY
SHORTAGES
-
OF
THE
GOOD
OLD
DAYS
OF
ABUNDANCE
-
NOW
IT
IS
MOTHER
WHO
PICKS
UP
RECIPES
FROM

HER
DAUGHTER
-
THE
DINNER
TABLE
IS
THE
BEST
ANSWER
TO
THE
GRUMBLERS
IN
BRITAIN
TODAY
-
-
THIS
IS
COLOUR
DAY
-
-
PROCLAIMED
THE
AMERICAN
COMMERCIAL
TV
CONTRACTORS
WANT
TO
DELAY
IT
FOR
10
YEARS
-
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
SETTLE
THIS
ARGUMENT
WITH
TWO
WORDS
TO
THE
BBC
-
-
GO
AHEAD
-
ONE
MAN
BEYOND
ALL
OTHERS
IS
SADDENED
BY
THE
DEATHS
OF
TWO
ELDERLY
SISTERS
WHO
KILLED
THEMSELVES
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
TO
LEAVE
THEIR
COTTAGE
-
MR
JOHN
CRABB
-
CLERK
TO
NEWMARKET
URBAN
COUNCIL
-
SAYS
-
-
I
SHALL
ALWAYS
FEEL
THIS
AS
A
PERSONAL
FAILURE
-
-
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
WHATSOEVER
WHY
HE
SHOULD
REPROACH
HIMSELF
-
THE
SISTERS
HAD
TO
QUIT
AS
THEIR
HOME
WAS
FALLING
DOWN
-
AND
MR
CRABB
DID
HIS
BEST
FOR
THEM
-
EVEN
DRIVING
THEM
TO
A
NEW
HOUSE
-
JOHN
CRABB
HAS
THE
QUALITIES
OF
SYMPATHY
AND
UNDERSTANDING
-
TOO
OFTEN
LACKING
IN
OFFICIALDOM
-
MR
HENRY
NEWTON
OF
ACTON
DOES
NOT
WANT
HIS
DAUGHTER
TO
MARRY
A
SCOTSMAN
-
HE
SAYS
THAT
THE
SCOTS
ARE
FOREIGNERS
WHO
HAVE
NO
BUSINESS
TO
BE
IN

-
THE
FIRST
RULER
OF
THE

-
THE
LORD

-
THE

AND
SO
WERE
FOUR
OF
HIS
PREDECESSORS
THIS
-
CENTURY
-
LET
MR
NEWTON
BEWARE
-
BY
PROTESTING
AGAINST
SCOTLAND
HE
MAY
BE
GUILTY
OF
REBELLION
-
ARCHBISHOP
MAKARIOS
PUTS
THE
COMMONWEALTH
ON
TRIAL
-
HIS
EXEOKA
GOVERNMENT
DECIDES
THAT
CYPRUS
WILL
JOIN
IT
FOR
FIVE
YEARS
-
DURING
THIS
PERIOD
BRITAIN
WILL
BE
EXPECTED
TO
SUBSIDISE
AND
DEFEND
THE
CYPRIOTS
-
THEY
WILL
ENJOY
ALL
THE
TRADING
BENEFITS
OF
IMPERIAL
PREFERENCE
-
IT
IS
A
SAFE
BET
THAT
AT
THE
END
OF
FIVE
YEARS
MAKARIOS
AND
COMPANY
WILL
SIGN
ON
AGAIN
-
IT
IS
EQUALLY
CERTAIN
THAT
THE
BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
WILL
WELCOME
THEM
-
HOW
SPLENDID
IT
WOULD
BE
IF
-
JUST
FOR
ONCE
-
THE
GOVERNMENT
WERE
TO
VOICE
THE
REAL
FEELINGS
OF
THE
BRITISH
PEOPLE
-
AND
TELL
MAKARIOS
THEY
ARE
NOT
PREPARED
TO
ACCEPT
HIM
ON
SUCH

GOOD
CHEER
FOR

-
FORD

ARE
TO

-
THE

SAID

NONSENSE
-
-
AS
USUAL
-
THE

HAVE
BEEN
PROVED
RIGHT
-
EARL
RUSSELL
AND
HIS
FRIENDS
HAVE
HIT
ON
AN
ORIGINAL
WAY
OF
SPENDING
THIS
AFTERNOON
-
THEY
INTEND
TO
SIT
OUTSIDE
THE
MINISTRY
OF
DEFENCE
-
IT
IS
THEIR
PROTEST
AGAINST
THE
HBOMB
-
THEY
OUGHT
TO
HAVE
A
PLEASANT
TIME
-
THE
WEATHER
FORECAST
IS
GOOD
-
EXCEPT
FOR
THEM
-
WHITEHALL

BE

A

CAUSE

BUT
IN
A
GLORIOUS
ONE
-
GOOD
HEALTH
-
IN
AN
EXTRA
TWO
OR
THREE
EVENINGS
-
AND
THEY
NEVER
GO
ON
STRIKE
-
TALENTS
AND
RESPONSIBILITIES
COULD
BRING
IN
THE
OPEN
LABOUR
MARKET
-
THE
UNIONS
ARE
FORTUNATE
INDEED
TO
FIND
DEDICATED
LEADERS
AT
CUTRATE
PRICES
-
BUT
IT
IS
UNDER
THE
LABOUR
GOVERNMENT
181
PER
CENT
OF
THE
NATIONAL
INCOME
WAS
SPENT
ON
SOCIAL
SERVICES
-
THE
PRESENT
FIGURE
IS
195
PER

THERE
ARE
MANY
WORTHWHILE
TARGETS
FOR
THE

-
WHAT
A

AT

-
MRS

-
WHOSE
HUSBAND
MADE

CLEAN
HIS

PONDER
HOW

ARE
MYSTERIOUSLY
RETURNED

-
THEIR

TIDIED

AND
OFTEN
-
EVEN
THEIR

CLEANED
-
HOW
WONDERFUL
IF
THEY
HOW
THE
GOVERNMENT
MUST
REPENT
ITS
HASTE
AND
FOLLY
IN
RHODESIA
-
EIGHTEEN
MONTHS
AGO
THIS
TERRITORY
WAS
PEACEFUL
-
ORDERLY
-
AND
THRIVING
-
AFRICANS
WITHIN
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
WERE
GETTING
VALUABLE
EXPERIENCE
IN
ADMINISTRATION
-
THEN
MR
IAIN
MACLEOD
BECAME
COLONIAL
SECRETARY
-
SUDDENLY
EVERYTHING
CHANGED
-
TIMETABLES
WERE
SCRAPPED
-
THE
ILLCONCEIVED
MONCKTON
COMMISSION
WAS
RUSHED
OUT
TO
RHODESIA
-
OVERNIGHT
-
MINOR
AFRICAN
POLITICIANS
WERE
INFLATED
INTO
INTERNATIONAL
FIGURES
-
AND
AS
THE
BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
STEPPED
UP
THE
PACE
OF
CHANGE
-
SO
THE
AFRICANS
STEPPED
UP
THEIR
DEMANDS
-
TODAY
-
IN
LONDON
-
THAT
RASH
AND
THOUGHTLESS
POLICY
HAS
CAUSED
A
CRISIS
-
A
CRISIS
THAT
NEVER
SHOULD
HAVE
HAPPENED
-
NO
WONDER
THERE
IS
DOUBT
AND
FEARFUL
HEARTSEARCHING
-
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
NOW
REVERSES
ITS
PLAN
TO
GIVE
THE
AFRICANS
CONTROL
IN
NORTHERN
RHODESIA
IT
MAY
INDEED
FACE
DIFFICULTIES
FROM
AFRICAN
POLITICIANS
GREEDY
FOR
POWER
-
BUT
IF
IT
FAILS
TO
MODIFY
THAT
PLAN
RHODESIA
MAY
WELL
BE
PLUNGED
INTO
CHAOS
-
LIKE
THE
CONGO
-
FOR
MR
MACMILLAN
AND
HIS
MINISTERS
THERE
IS
NO
CHOICE
-
THEY
MUST
SAFEGUARD
RHODESIA
AGAINST
CHAOS
-
AND
TRY
TO
REPAIR
THE
DAMAGE
THEY
HAVE
DONE
-
WHO
CAN
GROW
THE
FASTEST
-
THAT
IS
THE
EXCITING
COMPETITION
GOING
ON
AMONG
BRITAINS
MAJOR
INDUSTRIES
-
TOP
OF
THE
TABLE
-
AT
THE
MOMENT
-
IS
THE
CHEMICAL
INDUSTRY
-
THEN
COMES
ENGINEERING
-
FOLLOWED
BY
IRON
AND
STEEL
-
EVEN
THE
STAID
AND
TIMID
TREASURY
IS
CHEERED
BY
THE
TREMENDOUS
UPSURGE
IN

IT
REPORTS
THAT
NEW

THIS

IS
LIKELY
TO
BE
40
PER

UP
ON
1960
-
BRITAINS
BUSINESS
MEN
ARE
RIGHT
TO
BACK
THEIR
FAITH
WITH

-
FOR

TODAY
MEANS
STILL
GREATER
PROSPERITY
TOMORROW

HAS

LORD

HAVE

CERTAINLY
TEENAGERS

HOW

THE

THERE
IS
NO

WHAT
THE

UNDERSTAND
BY

IT
IS
THAT
THEY

TO

AS
MUCH
AS
THEY
LIKE

FROM

THE

NOT

WITH
ARGUING
THAT

WAS

FROM
THE

THAT

BETRAYED
AN

OF

IN
THE

OF

THAT
LED
TO

-
HE
UNDERSTOOD
THE

APPARATUS
WITH
AN
EXACT
AND
WHO
USED
THE
SYSTEM
-
AND
USED
IT
WITH
POWER
AND

-
THE
APPALLING
THING
ABOUT
THE

IS
THAT
THEY
CAN
KID
THEM
SELVES
AND
FEEL
A
SENSE
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHEN
THEIR
HANDS
ARE
RED
WITH
BLOOD
-
THEY
REALLY
BELIEVED
THAT
THE

THERE
IS

AFTER

THE

AT

BY
WHICH
THE

TOLD
THE

LAST

THE

THROUGH

HE
CONTINUED
THIS

THE
ARGUMENT
WITH
MR

WHICH
HE
HAD
IN
PUBLIC
AT
A
NATO
COUNCIL
MEETING
LAST
YEAR
OVER
THE
QUESTION
-
DO
WE
A

THE

FOR

ALL

WESTERN

IN
THE

GERMANY
HAS
SECURED

AFTER

THE

HAS
AGREED
TO

SIMILAR

-
THE

HAS
BEEN

FOR

AND
LAST

HE
ATTACKED

FOR
A

UNIFIED

IN

-
-
A
SUPPLY
APPARATUS
WHICH
WOULD
LINK
TOGETHER
THE

WILL

11

A

FIGHTER

COULD

AN

LAST

WAS
REPORTED
TO

TOWARD

STRAUSS
AND
HIS

HEUSINGER
-
THE
MAN
WHO
CAUSED
A
GREAT
DISTURBANCE
LAST
AUTUMN
ALL
THIS
HAS
BEEN
ACHIEVED
THROUGH

UNDER
AMERICAN
LEADERSHIP
-
BUT
A
BIG
ROLE
HAS
BEEN
PLAYED
NOT
ONLY
BY
THE
BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
BUT
BY
RIGHTWING

IN
THIS
COUNTRY
-
THEY
HAVE
HELPED
BUILD
UP
NATO
AND
REARM
WESTERN
GERMANY
-
IN
PURSUIT
OF
THE
OLD
FAMILIAR
ANTISOVIET
POLICY
WHICH
BROUGHT
DISASTER
IN
1939
-
NOW
THE
ARGUMENT
IS
BEING
USED
THAT
NATO
MUST
BE
MAINTAINED
AND
BRITAIN
MUST
STAY
IN
IT
TO
KEEP
THE
GERMANS
IN
CONTROL
-
NATO

FAR
FROM

TODAY

AGAIN
-
SHE
HAS
A

LET

TELL
MEN
LIKE

HIS

FOR

ARMS
-
A
POLICY
WHICH
BREAKS
WITH

ALLIANCES

NATO
AND
SEEKS
FRIENDSHIP

CAN
PREVENT
ANOTHER
BETRAYAL

BOROUGH

PARTY
CONFERENCE
I
AM
APPALLED
AT
THE
CHARACTER
OF
THE
CURRENT
FOR
MANY
YEARS
MY
UNION
HAD
TO
PRESENT
ITS
VIEWS
TO
THE
TWO
MAJOR
CONFERENCES
OF
THE

AND
TAKE
A
LICKING

FOR
US
-
UNITY
MEANT

UNPALATABLE
MAJORITY
DECISIONS
AS
BINDING
ON
THE
MOVEMENT
AND
HAVING
A
GO
NEXT

MANY
OTHERS

WE
CONDUCTED
OUR
FIGHT
BY
PUTTING
DOWN
-
UNAMBIGUOUS
ALTERNATIVES
TO
OFFICIAL
POLICY
AND
SEEKING
TO
WIN
MAJORITIES
WHEN
SCARBOROUGH
CARRIED
OUR
POINT
OF
VIEW
WE
WERE
NATURALLY
DELIGHTED
-
MORE
SO
BECAUSE
THE
ALTERNATIVES
HAD
BEEN
PUT
CLEARLY
TO
THE
MOVEMENT
-
WHICH
HAD
THEN
CHOSEN
A
VIGOROUS
ANTINATO
-
ANTITORY
-
ANTIBOMB
AND
ANTIGERMAN
REARMAMENT
POLICY
-
HOPES
ROSE
AS
WE
SAW
A
PERSPECTIVE
OF
SHARP
STRUGGLE
BASED
ON
CONSISTENT
LINES
OF

WITH
THE
TORIES
-
MANY
MEMBERS
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
THE
BREADANDBUTTER
STRUGGLES
OF
THE
UNION
WOULD
BECOME
EASIER
IN
THE
CONTEXT
FOR
WE
HAVE
ALWAYS
FELT
-
EVEN
IF
WE
HAVE
THEN
BY
OUR
PRACTICE
IGNORED
IT
-
THE
INCONSISTENCY
BETWEEN
SUPPORT
FOR
THE
WAR
SPENDING
ON
ARMAMENTS
-
AND
OUR
BASIC
EFFORT
TO
IMPROVE
LIVING
GAITSKELLITES
USING
THE
POSITION
OF
ORGANISATIONAL
DOMINANCE
ESTABLISHED
DURING
THEIR
YEARS
THEY
OBSTRUCTED
EVERY

TO

FOR
THE
SCARBOROUGH

WHILE

SCRATCHING
AROUND
FRANTICALLY
TO
OVERTURN
THEM
NEXT

CONFUSION
OF
THE
ORIGINAL

BY
MISREPRESENTATION
OF
THE

THE
INTRODUCTION
OF
A
PSEUDO
THIRD

A
DEMAND
THAT
THE

UNITE
WITH
THE
GAITSKELLITES
ON
THEIR
POLICY
AND
NO
OTHER
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
DONE
THE
TRICK
OF
MOVING
A
NUMBER
OF

IT
WOULD
BECOME
EASY
TO
BECOME
CYNICAL
AND
TO
DESPAIR
-
AND
YET
-
WHEREVER
THE
ISSUES
WERE
PUT
CLEARLY
-
SECTIONS
OF
THE
MOVEMENT
REAFFIRMED
THEIR
ORIGINAL
STAND
-
ONLY
WHERE
THE

WERE
POSED
SO
AS
TO
CAUSE
DOUBT
AND
CONFUSION
IMMEDIATE
CONFUSION
HIDES
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
PEACE
MOVEMENT
IS
STILL
ADVANCING
AND
THAT
CLARIFICATION
OF
THE
ISSUES
CAN
BRING
A
MAJORITY
TO
-
SECURE
THE
SCARBOROUGH
POWERFUL
UNITS
HAVE
STOOD

-
IN

WHERE
THE
CENTRAL

WERE
CONFUSED

CLEAR

THIS
-
AND
THE
NUMBERS
OF

UNDERSTAND
HOW

THE

PROVIDES
A

FOR
A

AGAINST

AND
FOR
A
CONSISTENT

THE

THAT
TO

IS
TO
EXPOSE
BRITAIN
AND
HER
WORKING

TO
SHARP
NEW
DANGERS

THAT
GAITSKELLISM

ORDINARY
WORKING

WILL
NEVER

TO

A

FOUNDED
ON
POLITICAL
CHICANERY
OR

THAT

THAT

UNITING
THOSE

AND
THOSE
WHO
ARE
FOR
THIS

IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE

AS
THE

BUT
ARE
IN

OF

-
THE
NEW

STATEMENT
-
WHILE
ACCEPTING
THAT
BRITAIN
CAN
NOT
REMAIN
AN

NOW
SUPPORTS
THE

OF
DEPENDING
ON

NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
AND
THE
HBOMB
-
PLACING
BRITAIN
IN
AN
EVEN
MORE
DANGEROUS
POSITION
-
THE
STATEMENT
OF
PADLEY
AND
CROSSMAN
IS
NO
DIFFERENT
IN

TO
THE

-
THEY
ACCEPT
AMERICAN

AND
ALSO
THE
USE

UNTIL
SOME
FUTURE

-
THEY
DECEIVE
THE

BY
THEIR

THE

THERE
IS

NOT

REBOOK
GENE
DETROY
AND
HIS
PERFORMING
CHIMPANZEES
SO
SOON
AFTER
THEIR
PREVIOUS
APPEARANCE
-
THEIR
OFFERING
LAST
NIGHT
DIFFERED
LITTLE
FROM
THEIR
EARLIER
ACT
ON
THIS

A

OR
SO
AGO
-
BUT
THE

-
WITH
JEFF

OUT
OF
THE

AND
BACK
WITH

MARY
AND

-
WERE
IN
BRIGHT

ZESTFUL
FORM

WHY

THOUGH
-
IT
WAS
NOT

-
-
A
FAIR
COP
-
-
THE
BBC
WHITEHALL
FARCE
LAST

-
LOOKED
LIKE
A
RABBIT
WARREN
IN
A
FIELD
OF
CORN
-
COMICS
BOLTED
IN
AND
OUT
OF
HOLES
SO
OFTEN
-
THE

WERE
A
RESHUFFLE
OF
THE
SAME
OLD
LOT
-
THIS
TIME
BRIAN
RIX
LOST
HIS
SKIRT
INSTEAD
OF
HIS

-
THE
ACTION
MOVED
AT
TREMENDOUS
SPEED
-
BACKED
BY
SOME
WONDERFUL
TIMING
BY
THE
CAST
-
I
ESPECIALLY
LIKED
THE
TEACUP
CUPS
WITH
THE
DEXTERITY
OF
CHINESE
JUGGLERS
-
CAROLE
SHELLEY
AS
THE
NEWLYWED
AND
LARRY
NOBLE
AS
SMILER
PERKINS
WERE
THE
MOST
LAUGHABLE
-
THEY
ALONE
USED
A
SHARP
EDGE
TO
THEIR
HUMOUR
AND
CUT
IT
WAS
ACCIDENTAL
-
I
HOPE
NOT
-
IF
EVER
A
BAG
OF
HUMOUR
NEEDED
A
THOROUGH
SHAKING
UP
THE
WHITEHALL
HOW
DO
YOU

THE

OF

IT

A
FEW
LEAVE
IT
OPEN
TO
SUPPOSE
THAT
THE

HAD
BEEN

THE
INGENUITY
OF

IS
IMPRESSIVE

THOMAS
SPRENG
CASE
IS
THAT
-
IN
COMMON
WITH
ALL
HIS

-
HE
HAS
NOT

UNTIL
NOW

BEEN
ABLE
TO
EXHIBIT
EXACTLY
HOW
THIS
ENLARGEMENT
WAS
EFFECTED
NOR
HAS
HE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
TEXTUAL
MOVEMENTS
BY
SHOWING
THAT
SUCH
CHANGES
ARE
PART
OF
A
SIMPLE
AND
COHERENT
PLAN
-
TO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
THIS
IS
POSSIBLE
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
EXAMINE
THE
TEXT
OF
THE
GOSPEL
-
THE
FOURTH
GOSPEL
WAS
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
WRITTEN
IN
GREEK
-
A
MODERN
TEXT
OF
THE
GOSPEL
REPRESENTS
THE
WORK
OF
GENERATIONS
OF
SCHOLARS
WHO
HAVE
COMPARED
THE
MANY
MANU
SCRIPTS
OF
JOHN
AND
WORKED
OUT
THE
VERSION
WHICH
IS
MOST
LIKELY
TO
HAVE
BEEN
THE
ORIGINAL
WORDING
-
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
ESTABLISH
ANY
ONE
TEXT
WITH
ABSOLUTE
PRECISION
-
THE
MOST
CONVENIENT
ONE
FOR
THE
AUTHORS
HAS
BEEN
THE
TEXT
OF
A
SOUTER
-
IN
THIS
VERSION
OF
THE
TEXT
THE
FOURTH

IS
PRINTED
AS
JUST
OVER
1000
DIFFERENT
NOUNS
-
VERBS
-
AND
OTHER
PARTS
OF
SPEECH
OCCURRING
FORMS
-
THERE
ARE
OTHER
TEXTS
WHICH
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
USED
-
AND
-
AS
SHOWN
IN
TABLE
1
-
IT
IS
NOT
A
MATTER
OF
THE
GREATEST
IMPORTANCE
WHICH
TEXT
IS
USED
-
AT
FIRST
SIGHT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
SOUTER
AND
THE
OTHER
TEXTS
IS
RATHER
LARGE
-
BUT
THE
BRITISH
TEXT
INCLUDES
THE
PARAGRAPH

THIS
ACCOUNTS
FOR
178

WHICH
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
15695
WORDS
OF

TEXT
AND
THE
15416

-
THE
OMISSION
OR
INCLUSION
OF
THIS
PARAGRAPH
IS
A
MATTER
OF
EDITORIAL
DECISION
RATHER
THE

WAS
THE
COMMONEST
MARKING
-
BUT
OTHERS
WERE
ALSO
USED

DOTS
SOMETIMES
SERVED

C
H
ROBERTS
IS
OF
THE
OPINION
THAT
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
OF
THE
FOURTH

SOME

WOULD
BE
USED
-
ALTHOUGH
WHICH
-
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO

THE

WHETHER
WRITTEN

-
WHETHER
PARAGRAPHED

WOULD

THIS

1
-
I
WILL
BRING
YOU
OUT
FROM
UNDER
THE
PEOPLE
-
-
1
-
I
WILL
BRING
YOU
OUT
FROM
UNDER
THE
BURDENS
OF
EGYPT
-
HOW
WAS
IT
THAT
ISRAEL
WAS
BROUGHT
OUT
FROM
UNDER
THE
BURDENS
OF
EGYPT
-
BECAUSE
-
THEY
KEPT
THE
PASSOVER
AND
THEY
WERE
EATING
MATZOS
IN
EGYPT
AND
THE
-
FEAST
OF
MATZOS
-
WAS
KNOWN
EVEN
TO
ABRAHAM
AND
LOT
-
THE
NEW
CENTURY
OPENED
WITH
JAMES
1
ASCENDING
THE
THRONE
-
HE
WAS
QUITE
PREPARED
TO
BE
TOLERANT
TOWARDS
ROME
THOUGH
THE
GUNPOWDER
PLOT
SPOILED
THAT
-
THE
PURITANS
HAD
HIGH
HOPES
-
FOR
JAMES
HAD
GROWN
UP
IN
PRESBYTERIAN
SCOTLAND
-
BUT
THOSE
HOPES
WERE
DASHED
-
TRUE
-
A
NEW
PRAYER
BOOK
WAS
ISSUED
IN
1604
BUT
THE
PURITANS
DERIVED
LITTLE
COMFORT
FROM
IT
-
THEY
OBJECTED
TO
THE
WORD
CONFIRMATION
-
SO
THE
PHRASE
-
OR
THE
LAYING
ON
OF
HANDS
UPON
CHILDREN
BAPTIZED
AND
ADDED
TO
THE
CATECHISM
-
THIS
INDICATED
HOW
EPHEMERAL
IN
THE
CHURCH
HAD
BEEN
THE
MOOD
WHICH
PRODUCED
THE
BLACK
RUBRIC
-
FOR
IT
SAYS
THAT
-
THE
BODY
AND
BLOOD
OF
CHRIST
-
WHICH
ARE
DEFINITE
-
IT
WAS
AT
THIS
TIME
-
TOO
-
THAT
KING
JAMES
MADE
A
BIBLE
TRANSLATION
-
THE
AUTHORIZED
VERSION
IN
THAT
YEAR
SHAKESPEARE
HAD
JUST
TURNED
FORTY
AND
HAD
WRITTEN
HAMLET
TWO
YEARS
BEFORE
-
BACON
WAS
AT
WORK
AND
MILTON
WAS
JUST
LEARNING
TO
READ
-
JAMES
WAS
FOLLOWED
BY
CHARLES
-
IN
WHOSE
REIGN
CAME
THE
SCOTTISH
PRAYER
BOOK
IN
1637
-
SIGNIFICANTLY
THIS
MADE
A
DELIBERATE
RETURN
TO
THE
BOOK
OF
1549
AND
BECAME
THE
FOSTER
MOTHER
OF
SOME
OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
PRAYER
BOOKS
IN
THE
ANGLICAN
COMMUNION
-
FOREVER
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CHARLES
IS
ARCHBISHOP
LAUD
-
NOW
SO
MUCH
NOBLER
A
FIGURE
THAN
FORMER
HISTORIANS
LED
US
TO
BELIEVE
-
LAUD
WAS
ENTHUSIASTICALLY
HATED
BY
CALVINISTS
AND
PURITANS
-
AND
THE
SENTIMENT
WAS
MUTUAL
-
BUT
LAUD
WAS
NO
ROMANIZER
-
ONE
OF
HIS
FIRST
PUBLIC
ACTS
WAS
A
HARDHITTING
BATTLE
WITH
THE
JESUIT
-
FISHER
-
BUT
ANYONE
WHO
WAS
FRIENDLY
WITH
JAMES
AND
CHARLES
-
THE
PURITANS
ARGUED
-
WAS
NECESSARILY
A
MENACE
-
LAUD
MADE
A
POSITIVE
APPROACH
-
HE
SET
OUT
TO
INCREASE
A
SENSE
OF
REVERENCE
-
THE
PRAYER
BOOK
WAS
TO
BE
RESPECTED
AND
SO
WAS
THE
OFFICE
OF
A
BISHOP
-
ALTARS
SHOULD
BE
ALTARS
AND
NOT
ANY
BROKEN
DOWN
-
TRANSPORTABLE
TABLE
WHICH
WAS
HANDY
FOR
THE
MOST
IMPROBABLE
USES
-
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
IT
IS
NOT
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
USE
TELLING
EVEN
CHILDREN
-
AS
I
HAVE
ALREADY
SUGGESTED
-
NOT
TO
BE
SILLY
OR
TO
PULL
THEMSELVES
TOGETHER
-
FAR
BETTER
TO
HELP
THEM
TO
FACE
WHATEVER
IT
IS
THAT
IS
WORRYING
THEM
-
TO
FIND
THE
ORIGINAL
CAUSE
AND
THEN
DEAL
WITH
IT
-
SHOW
IT
UP
EITHER
FOR
THE
SHAM
IT
IS
-
AND
MANY
FEARS
ARE
BASED
UPON
COMPLETELY
IRRATIONAL
PRECONCEIVED
NOTIONS
-
OR
TO
EVEN
WORSE
IS
TO
LAUGH
-
TREMENDOUS
DAMAGE
MAY
BE
DONE
TO
A
CHILD
BY
LAUGHING
AT
WHAT
ARE
VERY
REAL
FEARS
-
AS
ADULTS
-
WE
KNOW
THAT
THEIR
FEARS
ARE
GROUNDLESS
-
INDEED
TO
US
THEY
APPEAR
LAUGHABLE
-
BUT
TO
A
CHILD
THEY
ARE
VERY
REAL
-
NOT
THAT
I
AM
SUGGESTING
THAT
CHILDREN
SHOULD
BE
MOLLYCODDLED
-
THEY
MUST
BE
MADE
TO
FACE
THEIR
FEARS
-
TO
SEE
THROUGH
THEM
AND
COME
OUT
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
AS
VICTORS
-
TO
RIDICULE
THEM
ONLY
PUSHES
THEM
FARTHER
INTO
THEMSELVES
-
SO
THAT
THEY
BECOME
UNABLE
TO
SPEAK
ABOUT
IT
TO
ANYBODY
AND
THE
SEEDS
OF
ANY
AMOUNT
OF
TROUBLE
ARE
SOWN
-
THE
HARVEST
OF
WHICH
MAY
STILL
BE
BEING
REAPED
AT
FORTY
OR
FIFTY
-
FAR
BETTER
TO
AGREE
WITH
A
CHILD
THAT
A
PARTICULAR
SITUATION
IS
FRIGHTENING
-
AND
THEN
TO
FACE
IT
TOGETHER
UNTIL
THE
CHILD
CAN
SEE
HOW
UNNECESSARY
ITS
FEARS
WERE
-
BECAUSE
SITUATIONS
WHICH
MAY
CONTAIN
ALL
THE
ELEMENTS
OF
FEAR
CAN
ARISE
SUDDENLY
-
IT
IS
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
CONDITION
A
CHILD
TO
SOME
EXTENT
AGAINST
IT
-
TO
KEEP
A
CHILD
OF
TWELVE
OR
THIRTEEN
UNDER
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
NOTHING
NASTY
EVER
HAPPENS
IS
NOT
MERELY
DISHONEST
-
IT
IS
UNWISE
-
AS
I
SHALL
SUGGEST
IN
A
LATER
CHAPTER
THERE
ARE
SOME
SITUATIONS
WHICH
OCCUR
LESS
FREQUENTLY
THAN
A
LITTLE
MORE
HONESTY
-
EVEN
IF
ONE
REFRAINS
FROM
GOING
INTO
TOO
MANY
DETAILS
-
WOULD
HELP
MANY
A
CHILD
TO
MAKE
A
PROPER
ADJUSTMENT
TO
LIFE
AS
IT
GROWS
UP
-
LET
US
LOOK
AT
JESUS
-
WE
DO
NOT
-
I
THINK
-
SEE
THERE
A
LIFE
WITHOUT
FEAR
-
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
INSTANCES
WHERE
HE
SEEMED
UNABLE
TO
GO
ON
-
IN
GETHSEMANE
HE
PRAYED
THAT
THE
CUP
SHOULD
PASS
FROM
HIM
-
JESUS
SHOWS
US
THE
WAY
TO
FACE
LIFE
-
TO
SEE
ALL
THE
LATENT
FRIGHTENING
POSSIBILITIES
AND
YET
BY
FACING
THEM
AND
KNOWING
GOD
IS
WITH
US
AND
THAT
-
WITH
HIM
-
THERE
IS
NOTHING
THAT
CAN
FINALLY
DEFEAT
US
-
MORE
THAN
THAT
-
THAT
GOD
HAS
SOMETHING
IMPORTANT
TO
DO
WITH
OUR
LIVES
AND
THAT
THE
NEARER
WE
GET
TO
HIM
-
THE
STRONGER
WE
BECOME
-
WAS
THIS
-
THAT
A
SECRET
PLAN
IS
HID
IN
BECAUSE
OF
THE
PLAN
THAT
GOD
-
WHO
DWELLS
IN
MY
HAND
-
KNOWS
THIS
SECRET
PLAN
-
OF
THE
THINGS
HE
WILL
DO
FOR
THE
WORLD
USING
MY
HAND
-
TOYOHIKO
KAGAWA
-
LOVING
SAVIOUR
-
WHO
EXPERIENCED
ALL
HUMAN
EMOTION
-
AND
WHOSE
SENSITIVE
NATURE
KNOWS
BETTER
THAN
WE
DO
-
WHAT
IT
IS
TO
BE
REALLY
AFRAID
-
HELP
US
TO
KNOW
THAT
WHEN
WE
FACE
LIFE
BOLDLY
-
MANY
OF
THE
SHADOWS
ARE
COME
WHAT
MAY
-
WE
ARE
NEVER
ALONE
WHEN
WE
ARE
WITH
THEE
-
AMEN
-
MOST
PEOPLE
WOULD
PROBABLY
REGARD
TIREDNESS
AS
A
PURELY
PHYSICAL
THING
-
THE
CURE
FOR
WHICH
IS
SLEEP
-
THIS
IS
ONLY
PARTLY
TRUE
-
MANY
PEOPLE
WAKE
UP
TIRED
OF
A
MORNING
AND
NO
AMOUNT
OF
REST
SEEMS
TO
MAKE
ANY
DIFFERENCE
-
SLEEP
-
TO
BE
EFFECTIVE
-
MUST
BE
OF
THAT
CHILDLIKE
QUALITY
WHICH
COMES
TO
OTHERS
-
THE
LONG
HOURS
OF
THE
NIGHT
BRING
ONLY
A
DISTURBED
TOSSING
AND
TURNING
WHICH
CAUSES
THEM
TO
WAKE
FEELING
WORSE
THAN
WHEN
THEY
WENT
TO
BED
-
WE
MAY
BEGIN
TO
UNDERSTAND
THIS
A
LITTLE
BETTER
WHEN
WE
REALIZE
THAT
TIREDNESS
ITSELF
IS
LARGELY
IN
THE
MIND
-
VERY
FEW
PEOPLE
-
UNDER
NORMAL
CONDITIONS
-
WORK
THEMSELVES
TO
A
STANDSTILL
-
THE
MIND
TIRES
FIRST
AND
CONVEYS
THE
IMPRESSION
OF
TIREDNESS
TO
THE
BODY
-
THIS
CAN
BE
PROVED
BY
NOTING
THE
EFFECT
OF
A
NEW
STIMULUS
ON
SOME
BODY
WHO
FEELS
THOROUGHLY
TIRED
-
SUPPOSE
A
MOTHER
HAS
NEWS
LATE
AT
NIGHT
THAT
HER
CHILD
IS
IN
DANGER
-
SHE
WILL
UNDERTAKE
A
JOURNEY
WHICH
-
AN
HOUR
BEFORE
-
SHE
WOULD
HAVE
DECLARED
IMPOSSIBLE
-
EVEN
MORE
SIMPLY
-
TEST
YOUR
OWN
REACTIONS
TO
DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS
-
THERE
ARE
SOME
WHICH
BRING
ON
AN
ALMOST
IMMEDIATE
FEELING
OF
TIREDNESS
-
SUCH
AS
WHEN
YOUR
WIFE
MENTIONS
REFER
TO
SOMETHING
YOU
LIKE
DOING
-
BRING
A
VERITABLE
SURGE
OF
ENERGY
-
MANY
A
GIRL
WHO
UP
WITH
NO
APPARENT
TIREDNESS
AT
ALL
WHEN
HER
BOY
FRIEND
CALLS
AND
GO
FOR
A
LONG
WALK
-
NOR
IS
SHE
NECESSARILY
BEING
DECEITFUL
-
SHE
REALLY
DID
FEEL
TIRED
UNTIL
THE
MIND
GOT
THE
NECESSARY
INJECTION
OF
A
FRESH
-
AND
AN
ATTRACTIVE
-
INTEREST
-
TIREDNESS
HAS
-
THEREFORE
-
AS
MUCH
TO
DO
WITH
OUR
MENTAL
STATE
AS
WITH
OUR
PHYSICAL
EXHAUSTION
-
A
DISTURBED
MIND
CAN
BRING
THE
HEALTHIEST
BODY
TO
A
SENSE
OF
FATIGUE
-
THEY
WONDER
WHY
THEY
GET
NO
REST
AT
NIGHT
-
EVEN
IF
THEY
DO
SLEEP
-
A
BURDEN
TO
THEIR
FAMILIES
AND
THEIR
FRIENDS
-
ANY
MENTAL
CONFUSION
CAN
CAUSE
THIS
AND
THE
BEST
WAY
IS
PROBABLY
TO
SEEK
ADVICE
-
AS
WE
ARE
UNABLE
TO
CURE
OUR
OWN
BODIES
IF
THE
CAUSE
OF
OUR
PAIN
IS
TOO
DEEP
SEATED
-
SO
WE
ARE
UNABLE
TO
CURE
OUR
OWN
MINDS
-
INVOLVING
CAREFUL
AND
PATIENT
TREATMENT
-
ONE
OF
THE
GREATEST
STEPS
FORWARD
THAT
HAS
BEEN
MADE
THIS
CENTURY
IS
THE
WAY
IN
WHICH
ILLNESS
OF
THE
MIND
IS
NO
LONGER
FEARED
OR
SHUNNED
-
AND
IS
IN
FACT
NO
DIFFERENTLY
REGARDED
THAN
PHYSICAL
ILLNESS
-
THERE
IS
-
NEVERTHELESS
-
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
TIREDNESS
WHICH
COMES
FROM
NO
MAJOR
COMPLICATION
BUT
RESULTS
FROM
AN
INABILITY
TO
DEAL
WITH
LIFE
-
ESPECIALLY
UNDER
THE
DIVERSE
PATTERN
WHICH
IS
THE
TWENTIETH
CENTURY
-
IN
THE
DAYS
WHEN
MOST
PEOPLE
WERE
BORN
-
LIVED
AND
DIED
WITHIN
THE
BOUNDARIES
OF
THE
VILLAGE
-
IT
WAS
NOT
DIFFICULT
FOR
ANYBODY
TO
LIVE
A
DAY
AT
A
TIME
-
EVEN
THOSE
WHO
HELD
A
HIGH
AND
RESPONSIBLE
OFFICE
LIVED
IN
FAR
GREATER
SIMPLICITY
THAN
THEIR
SUCCESSORS
-
WHEN
NEWS
FROM
THE
CONTINENT
TOOK
DAYS
-
FROM
AMERICA
WEEKS
-
FROM
THE
FAR
EAST
-
MONTHS
-
EVEN
A
PRIME
MINISTER
COULD
GO
TO
SLEEP
IN
BLISSFUL
IGNORANCE
OF
WHAT
MIGHT
INDIVIDUAL
HAS
BECOME
SO
COMPLEX
THAT
IT
TAXES
THE
MIND
-
TWO
HUNDRED
PIECE
-
NOW
A
MAN
MAY
LIVE
TWENTY
-
THIRTY
EVEN
SIXTY
MILES
FROM
HIS
WORK
-
THE
ONLY
CONNEXION
IS
THE
PIPELINE
OF
THE
RAILWAY
ON
WHICH
THEY
TRAVEL
DAY
BY
DAY
-
THEIR
PLACE
OF
WORK
AND
THEIR
ASSOCIATES
AT
ARE
POSSIBLY
LIKE
IN
THE
SURROUNDINGS
OF
THEIR
HOMES
-
IT
IS
EASY
-
DESPERATELY
EASY
-
TO
LEAD
A
-
DOUBLE
-
LIFE
WITHOUT
EVER
DELIBERATELY
PLANNING
TO
DO
SO
OR
IN
FACT
BEING
CONSCIOUS
OF
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
-
IT
IS
EASIER
TO
LIVE
LIFE
IN
COMPARTMENTS
BUT
OVER
THE
YEARS
IT
BUILDS
UP
-
AND
TO
DO
SO
INEVITABLY
BUILDS
UP
TENSIONS
WHICH
CAN
WE
THEN
FRAME
SOME
-
RULES
-
WHICH
MAY
ENABLE
US
TO
LIVE
LIFE
AS
FULLY
AS
POSSIBLE
-
WITHOUT
HAVING
OUR
ENERGY
SAPPED
BY
UN
WE
HAVE
A
SAYING
-
MY
HEAD
WILL
NEVER
SAVE
MY
FEET
-
-
TIME
AFTER
TIME
WE
FORGET
SOMETHING
AND
HAVE
TO
GO
BACK
UPSTAIRS
OR
DOWN
TO
THE
SHOPS
-
IF
WE
EVER
STOPPED
TO
CONSIDER
HOW
MUCH
ENERGY
-
AND
TIME
-
WE
LOSE
THIS
WAY
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
A
DAY
WE
WOULD
BE
BECOME
TOO
PERNICKETY
-
NEVERTHELESS
-
WE
COULD
ALL
PROBABLY
BE
A
LITTLE
MORE
ORDERLY
FOR
WE
SO
FREQUENTLY
JUST
MUDDLE
THROUGH
-
THE
HOUSEWIFE
WOULD
FIND
LIFE
FAR
LESS
TIRING
IF
SHE
MADE
A
LIST
-
FOLLOWED
A
ROUTINE
OF
WORK
RATHER
THAN
GETTING
FROM
ONE
THING
TO
THE
NEXT
-
THE
BUSINESS
MAN
WOULD
FIND
THAT
HE
REACHED
THE
END
OF
THE
DAY
WITH
FAR
LESS
STRAIN
IF
HE
WAS
A
LITTLE
MORE
SYSTEMATIC
-
TO
DRIFT
AIMLESSLY
ALONG
IS
MORE
WEARYING
THAN
ANY
THING
ELSE
-
IF
WE
WOULD
ONLY
SIT
DOWN
AND
WRITE
OUT
ALL
THE
NECESSARY
JOBS
WAITING
TO
BE
DONE
AND
THEN
WORK
QUIETLY
THROUGH
THEM
-
WE
WOULD
FIND
LIFE
CONSIDERABLY
LESS
EXHAUSTING
THERE
MAY
BE
SOME
WHO
WILL
ARGUE
THAT
ROUTINE
DESTROYS
THE
SOUL
-
IT
IS
SO
EASY
-
THEY
SAY
-
TO
GET
INTO
A
RUT
-
SAVE
US
FROM
THE
SCHOOL
CURRICULUM
AND
EVEN
WORSE
THE
SCHOOL
SYSTEM
WHEREBY
FOR
MEALS
EVERYBODY
KNOWS
BEFOREHAND
EXACTLY
WHAT
-
ON
ANY
GIVEN
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
-
THEY
ARE
GOING
TO
HAVE
-
IF
-
SUCH
A
CRITIC
MAY
SAY
-
YOU
ARE
CALLING
US
TO
ADVENTURE
-
DO
NOT
STRANGLE
US
BEFORE
I
AM
MORE
THAN
CONSCIOUS
OF
THIS
-
HOW
ANYBODY
CAN
GO
THROUGH
THE
SAME
ROUTINE
DAY
IN
AND
DAY
OUT
FOR
FORTY
YEARS
I
FIND
DIFFICULT
TO
UNDERSTAND
-
A
LOT
OF
IT
IS
INEVITABLE
SO
THAT
INDUSTRY
AND
COMMERCE
MAY
BE
KEPT
GOING
-
THOUGH
IF
EVER
IT
BECOMES
POSSIBLE
TO
WORK
OUT
A
SYSTEM
OF
-
STAGGERED
-
HOURS
IT
MAY
DO
AN
IMMENSE
AMOUNT
OF
GOOD
OVER
AND
ABOVE
RELIEVING
AS
IT
IS
-
WITH
SO
MUCH
OF
OUR
LIFE
ALREADY
IN
A
PREDETERMINED
GROOVE
-
I
WOULD
HARDLY
LIKE
TO
ADD
FURTHER
TO
THE
DULLNESS
FOR
THIS
-
I
KNOW
HOW
MUCH
OF
A
DRAG
IT
CAN
BE
AND
I
WAS
INTERESTED
SOME
LITTLE
WHILE
AGO
TO
HEAR
OF
A
SCHOOL
WHO
TRIED
A
SIX
DAY
TIMETABLE
-
THEY
ONLY
WORKED
-
OF
COURSE
-
A
FIVE
DAY
WEEK
SO
THAT
IN
THE
FIRST
WEEK
MONDAY
TO
FRIDAY
WERE
DAYS
ONE
TO
FIVE
OF
THE
TIMETABLE
-
THE
FOLLOWING
MONDAY
WAS
DAY
SIX
AND
TUESDAY
STARTED
DAY
ONE
AGAIN
AND
SO
ON
-
BY
THIS
MEANS
THEY
AVOIDED
EACH
WEEK
BEING
THE
SAME
WITH
A
PUPIL
KNOWING
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
SUBJECT
WOULD
BE
ON
FRIDAY
AFTERNOON
AT
3
PM
-
IT
WAS
A
LITTLE
COMPLICATED
TO
WORK
-
NOTICE
IN
THE
ENTRANCE
SAYING
WHICH
DAY
OF
THE
TIMETABLE
IT
WAS
-
BUT
AND
KEPT
EVERYBODY
ON
THEIR
TOES
-
TO
HAVE
ORDER
DOES
NOT
MEAN
GETTING
INTO
A
DULL
ROUTINE
-
I
HAVE
GREAT
SYMPATHY
WITH
THE
YOUNG
WIFE
WHO
DOES
NOT
ALWAYS
WANT
TO
DO
I
WOULD
NOT
WANT
TO
EITHER
-
BUT
IF
SHE
WANTS
TO
GET
THROUGH
SIT
DOWN
QUIETLY
AND
MAKE
A
LIST
OF
EVERYTHING
SHE
HAS
GOT
TO
DO
-
NOTE
THE
ORDER
IN
WHICH
THEY
CAN
MOST
CONVENIENTLY
BE
DONE
-
OR
MUST
BE
DONE
BECAUSE
OF
OTHER
PREDETERMINED
FACTORS
-
YOU
MUST
-
FOR
EXAMPLE
-
DO
YOUR
SHOPPING
ON
THE
MORNING
OF
SHE
WILL
-
IN
FACT
-
BE
SURPRISED
AT
WHAT
PEACE
PUT
ALL
OUR
ENERGIES
INTO
THE
PARTICULAR
MATTER
ON
HAND
-
-
ACTUALLY
-
THE
MISHNAH
QUOTES
TWO
FURTHER
PROOF
TEXTS
AND
THE
GEMARA
EXPLAINS
WHY
THESE
-
TOO
-
ARE
NECESSARY
-
BUT
A
CAREFUL
EXAMINATION
OF
THAT
PASSAGE
MAKES
IT
CLEAR
THAT
THESE
ARE
NOT
QUOTED
HERE
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NOT
NECESSARY
TO
PROVE
THE
POINT
MADE
BY
R
JOSHUA
B
LEVI
-
-
FINALLY
-
WE
NOTE
THAT
THE
COMMENT
OF
RAMI
BAR
RABH
IS
QUOTED
ELSEWHERE
-
FROM
THE
ABOVE
IT
FOLLOWS
THAT
HERE
-
ONCE
AGAIN
-
WE
HAVE
A
GOOD
ILLUSTRATION
OF
HOW
A
SUGYA
HAS
BEEN
FASHIONED
FROM
MATERIAL
ALREADY
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
THE
REDACTORS
-
THE
SUGYA
IS
BUILT
AROUND
THE
SAYING
OF
R
JOSHUA
B
LEVI
-
THE
PROOF
TEXT
FOR
THE
READING
OF
THE
BOOK
OF
ESTHER
IS
QUOTED
WITH
THE
COMMENT
GIVEN
BY
SAMUEL
-
KNOWN
COMMENT
ON
THE
VERSE
-
QUOTED
BY
SAMUEL
IN
SUPPORT
OF
HIS
THESIS
AND
QUOTED
BY
THE
GEMARA
IN
SUPPORT
OF
R
JOSHUA
B
LEVIS
THESIS
-
-
THE
PROOF
TEXT
OF
GREETING
BY
THE
DIVINE
NAME
IS
TAKEN
FROM
THE
MISHNAH
-
THERE
IS
NO
REFERENCE
TO
THE
MISHNAH
HERE
BECAUSE
THE
MISHNAH
DEALS
WITH
THE
ACTUAL
PRACTICE
OF
GREETING
BY
THE
DIVINE
NAME
AND
THE
GEMARA
HERE
QUOTES
THE
TEXTS
TO
SUPPORT
THE
THESIS
OF
R
JOSHUA
B
LEVI
-
THE
QUESTION
AND
ANSWER
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
NEED
FOR
THE
TEXT
OF
THE
ANGEL
ARE
QUOTED
HERE
IN
THE
SAME
WORDS
IN
WHICH
THEY
ARE
QUOTED
IN
THE
DISCUSSION
ON
THE
MISHNAH
-
THIS
CAN
EITHER
MEAN
THAT
BOTH
SUGYAS
ARE
ANSWER
OR
THAT
OUR
SUGYA
IS
QUOTING
FROM
THE
LONGER
SUGYA
WHICH
DEALS
WITH
ALL
FOUR
TEXTS
QUOTED
IN
THE
MISHNAH
-
OR
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
OUR
SUGYA
CONTAINS
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
AND
ANSWER
AND
THIS
IS
QUOTED
IN
THE
OTHER
SUGYA
-
-
THIS
CAN
BE
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
ACCORD
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
APPROVAL
OF
HIS
ACTION
EXPRESSION
APPEARS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
FRAMED
IN
WHETHER
THE
HEAVENLY
COURT
CONCURRED
THE
PROOF
TEXT
OF
BRINGING
THE
TITHE
TO
THE
TEMPLE
IS
THEN
QUOTED
AND
THE
INTERPRETATION
OF
THE
LATTER
PART
OF
THE
VERSE
BY
RAMI
BAR
RABH
IS
ADDED
-
NOT
BECAUSE
THIS
IS
AT
ALL
RELEVANT
A
FAMILIAR
INTERPRETATION
WHICH
HAD
BECOME
SO
WELL
KNOWN
THAT
IT
WAS
INVARIABLY
QUOTED
WHENEVER
THE
VERSE
ITSELF
WAS
QUOTED
-
ALMOST
AS
IF
IT
WERE
A
PART
OF
THE
VERSE
-
THE
GEMARA
CONTINUES
WITH
A
SAYING
OF
THE
PALESTINIAN
TEACHER
-
R
ELEAZAR
-
3RD
CENT
-
-
-
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
MANIFESTED
ITSELF
IN
THREE
PLACES
-
THE
COURT
OF
SHEM
-
THE
COURT
OF
SAMUEL
OF
RAMAH
-
AND
THE
COURT
OF
SOLOMON
-
-
THE
PLACE
OF
THIS
ON
THE
SAYING
OF
R
JOSHUA
B
LEVI
WHICH
DEALS
WITH
A
SIMILAR
THEME
-
WE
KNOW
FROM
THE
DIARIES
OF
SAMUEL
PEPYS
THAT
HE
WAS
A
GREAT
MAN
FOR
LACE
-
PAYING
AS
MUCH
AS
3
FOR
A
LACE
COLLAR
-
BUT
THIS
DIDNT
MEAN
HE
WAS
PREPARED
TO
DO
AS
MUCH
FOR
HIS
LADY
-
FOR
HE
RECORDS
TESTILY
-
-
MY
WIFE
AND
I
FELL
OUT
ABOUT
MY
NOT
BEING
WILLING
TO
HAVE
HER
GOWN
LACED

-
REIGN
OF
CHARLES

STATING

WITH
A
BROAD

LACED

WITH

LACE
ABOUT
FOUR

AND
AMONG
THE
EFFECTS
LEFT
BY
NELL

IS
AN
UNPAID

FOR
-
SCARLET
SATIN
SHOES
WITH
SILVER
LACE
-
-
THE
RECORDS
OF
THESE
TENDER
TRIFLES
ARE
VERY
TOUCHING
BUT
THEN
LACE
DOES
PLACE
UPON
EVERYTHING
A
DELICATE
SENTIMENT
-
LUCKY
INDEED
ARE
THE
FAMILIES
THAT
POSSESS
A
HERITAGE
OF
LACE
-
A
LACE
BRIDAL
VEIL
HANDED
DOWN
FROM
MOTHER
TO
DAUGHTERS
-
A
LACETRIMMED
CHRISTENING
ROBE
THAT
EACH
GENERATION
WEARS
IN
TURN
-
THESE
ARE
PROUD
POSSESSIONS
-
LINKED
TO
THE
EXQUISITE
LACEMAKING
OF
THE
PAST
-
BUT
LACEMAKING
IS
BY
NO
MEANS
A
LOST
ART
-
IT
SUFFERED
A
DECLINE
AND
FELL
INTO
LAMENTABLY
LOW
STANDARDS
IN
THE
FUSSY
OVERFURNISHING
OF
THE
VICTORIAN
AGE
BUT
IT
WOULD
TAKE
MORE
THAN
A
TEMPORARY
LAPSE
IN
GOOD
TASTE
TO
DESTROY
THIS
LOVELY
-
VIABLE
CRAFT
-
IT
HAS
-
IN
FACT
-
READILY
ADAPTED
ITSELF
TO
MODERN
TASTES
AND
THE
ILL
USTRATIONS
IN
THE
FOLLOWING
PAGES
WILL
SHOW
HOW
COMPLETELY
IT
IS
IN
SYMPATHY
WITH
CON
TEMPORARY
SURROUNDINGS
-
IT
WILL
BE
SEEN
HOW
-
WITH
BOLD
DESIGN
AND
RICH
COLOUR
-
KNITTING
-
CROCHET
AND
TATTING
IN
FINE
AND
MEDIUMWEIGHT
COTTONS
CAN
GIVE
STRIKING
INDIVIDUALITY
TO
MANY
THINGS
IN
THE
HOME
-
CHAIRBACKS
-
CUSHIONS
-
TABLECLOTHS
-
TO
MENTION
ONLY
THREE
-
HOW
SATISFYING
IT
IS
TO
AVOID
THE
READYMADE
IN
THESE
AND
BY
ONES
OWN
HANDIWORK
PRODUCE
SOMETHING
THAT
REFLECTS
TRUE
CREATIVE
TALENT
-
THE
MORE
DELICATE
PATTERNS
AND
FINER

MAY
BE

-
FINELACE
INSERTION
ON
A
PETTICOAT
OR

-
A

THESE
ADD
A
CHARMING
-
FEMININE
DISTINCTION
THAT
NOTHING
ELSE
CAN
GIVE
-
ALTHOUGH
WE
ASSESS
LACEMAKING
AS
ONE
OF
THE
FEMININE
SKILLS
-
A
NUMBER
OF
THE
WELLLOVED
TRADITIONAL
PATTERNS
THAT
WE
FOLLOW
TODAY
WERE
-
IN

-
THE
BRAINCHILDREN
OF
INVENTIVE
MEN
-
FOR
IN
THE
OLD
ORDER
OF
THINGS
-
MEN
DESIGNED
AND
WORKED

AS
WELL
AS

AND
SPECIAL

WERE
SET
UP
TO
TEACH
LACE
MAKING
NOT
ONLY
TO
YOUNG

-
BUT
TO
LITTLE
LIVELIHOOD
BY
LACEMAKING
AND
CONSEQUENTLY
A
FOLKLORE
OF
SONG
-
FESTIVAL
AND
COURTSHIP
GREW
UP
AROUND
THE
LACE
INDUSTRY
-
DURING
THE
SIXTEENTH
CENTURY
A
CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNT
OF
CROCHET
WAS
PRODUCED
IN
THE
CONVENTS
OF
EUROPE
-
WITHOUT
DOUBT
IT
WAS
THE
NUNS
WHO
CARRIED
THE
CRAFT
TO
IRELAND
-
THERE
IT
WAS
DEVELOPED
INTO
QUITE
AN
ELABORATE
AND
DISTINCTIVE
FORM
WITH
ROSETTES
-
LEAVES
AND
LACE
FILLINGS
-
DURING
THE
TIME
OF
VICTORIA
THIS
GENTLE
CRAFT
WAS
GREATLY
ABUSED
-
ONE
CAN
REMEMBER
WITH
HORROR
THE
PICTURES
OF
THE
OVERCROWDED
AND
OVEREMBELLISHED
DRAWINGROOMS
COMPLETE
WITH
HEAVY
CROCHET
ANTIMACASSARS
-
MANTEL
PIECE
COVERS
WITH
A
FRINGING
OF
CLUMSY
BOBBLES
AND
NUMEROUS
OTHER
CROCHETED
PIECES
-
IT
WAS
SOME
YEARS
AFTER
THE
VICTORIAN
PERIOD
THAT
DESIGNERS
REALISED
THE
POTENTIALITIES
OF
THE
CRAFT
-
AND
CROCHET
WAS
REVIVED
WITH
DESIGNS
SUITABLE
FOR
CONTEMPORARY
TRENDS
-
CROCHET
TODAY
HAS
A
VARIETY
OF
USES

A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
MODERN
FURNITURE
HAS
TAPERED
LEGS
-
AND
IN
REPRODUCTION
PERIOD
PIECES
THEY
ARE
FREQUENTLY
USED
-
THE
SIMPLER
VARIETIES
ARE
EXTREMELY
EASY
TO
WORK
-
THE
FOUR
SIDES
BEING
THE
MORE
ELABORATE
VARIETIES
-
HOWEVER
-
A
TOE
IS
WORKED
IN
THE
SOLID
-
AND
THIS
CERTAINLY
COMPLICATES
THE
OPERATION
-
FOR
SHORT
ONES
A
SMOOTHING
PLANE
CAN
BE
USED
-
THE
GAUGE
CAN
NOW
BE
USED
TO
NICK
IN
THE
TAPERS
ON
THE
NEWLY
PLANED
SURFACES
-
AND
THESE
TREATED
AS
BEFORE
-
IT
IS
UNNECESSARY
TO
MARK
THE
TAPER
WITH
OF
THE
PLANE
SOLE
TO
MAKE
THE
TAPERED
SURFACES
A
GLANCE
AT
THE
GAUGE
MARKS
AT
THE
BOTTOM
END
REVEALS
WHEN
THE
REQUIRED
AMOUNT
HAS
BEEN
REMOVED
-
AND
IF
CARE
IS
TAKEN
TO
STOP
THE
PLANE
SHORT
OF
THE
SQUARED
PENCIL
LINE
AT
THE
TOP
-
THE
WORK
WILL
BE
ACCURATE
-
THE
STRAIGHTEDGE
CAN
BE
USED
TO
TEST
THE
STRAIGHTNESS
OF
THE
SIDES
-
INCIDENTALLY
-
IT
IS
BETTER
TO
THE
OUTER
SURFACES
BEING
VERTICAL
AS
AT
-
B
-
-
FIG
1
-
TO
MAKE
A
LEG
SUCH
AS
NOTE
THAT
SQUARED
LINES
MARKING
THE
TOP
MEMBER
OF
THE
TOE
ARE
NEEDED
AS
WELL
AS
THE
UPPER
EX
TENT
OF
THE
TAPER
-
AND
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
MARK
IN
THE
LINE
OF
THE
TAPER
WITH
PENCIL
AND
STRAIGHTEDGE
MADE
AT
THE
UPPER
TOE
LINE
EXACTLY
DOWN
TO
THE
TAPER
LINE
-
NO
FARTHER
-
ARE
MANY
REASONS
-
WOOD
IS
IN
GOOD
AND
COMMON
SUPPLY
-
IT
LENDS
ITSELF
TO
MAKING
INNUMERABLE
USEFUL
HOUSEHOLD
ITEMS
-
FURNITURE
-
FITMENTS
-
GARDEN
ITEMS
-
TOYS
-
ETC
-
IT
ENABLES
RESULTS
TO
BE
OBTAINED
FAIRLY
QUICKLY
-
IT
IS
LESS
EXPENSIVE
THAN
MOST
OTHER
MATERIALS
-
IT
IS
A
PLEASANT
MATERIAL
CREATE
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
MESS
-
IT
IS
ALL
CLEAN
AND
EASILY
CLEARED
AWAY
-
THIS
LAST
POINT
IS
CERTAINLY
IMPORTANT
BECAUSE
ALMOST
ARE
NOT
ONLY
AN
ECONOMIC
NECESSITY
-
BUT
THAT
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
DRUDGERY
CAN
BE
AVOIDED
BY
THE
RIPPING
OUT
PARTS
FROM
HARDWOOD
-
MOST
MEN
WOULD
UNHESITATINGLY
USE
A
MACHINE
IF
IT
COMING
NOW
TO
THE
ACTUAL
TOOLS
AND
THEIR
COST
-
WE
BEGIN
WITH
WHAT
WE
HAVE
CALLED
A
BARE
MINIMUM
KIT
-
PROBABLY
MOST
MEN
HAVE
SOME
OF
THE
TOOLS
ALREADY
-
IT
WILL
ENABLE
A
MAN
TO
MAKE
SIMPLE
-
STRAIGHTFORWARD
THINGS
-
AND
IN
ANY
CASE
MAY
BE
REGARDED
AS
A
GOOD
BEGINNING
TO
WHICH
OTHER
TOOLS
CAN
BE
ADDED
AS
THE
NEED
ARISES
-
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
WORK
WILL
PROBABLY
DICTATE
THE
ADDITIONS
TO
BE
MADE
-
BUT
AS
A
GUIDE
WE
HAVE
GIVEN
A
FULLER
KIT
WHICH
INCREASES
THE
RANGE
OF
THINGS
THAT
CAN
BE
MADE
ENORMOUSLY
-
AS
A
STILL
FURTHER
DEVELOPMENT
-
WE
FOLLOW
WITH
A
GOOD
BASIC
KIT
-
WHICH
INCLUDES
WITH
THIS
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
JOBS
CAN
BE
DONE
-
THOUGH
FOR
ADVANCED
CABINET
WORK
THE
NECESSITY
FOR
CERTAIN
SPECIAL
TOOLS
WILL
BECOME
OBVIOUS
-
LASTLY
-
WE
SUGGEST
CERTAIN
POWER
TOOLS
AND
MACHINES
-
THE
CHOICE
OF
WHICH
WILL
DEPEND
PARTLY
UPON
THE
SPACE
AVAILABLE
IN
THE
WORKSHOP
-
THE
AMOUNT
ONE
IS
PREPARED
TO
PAY
-
AND
THE
TYPE
OF
WORK
A
MAN
NORMALLY
DOES
-
FIRST
-
HOWEVER
-
A
WORD
OF
ADVICE
GENERALLY
-
DO
NOT
BUY
SOCALLED
CHEAP
TOOLS
OR
MACHINES
-
THEY
NEVER
ARE
CHEAP
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
-
THEY
MAY
BE
INACCURATE
-
MOST
TOOLS
HAVE
TO
LEAD
AN
INTENSIVE
LIFE
-
AND
FAULTS
IN
DESIGN
OR
QUALITY
SOON
BECOME
APPARENT
-
IT
IS
FAR
BETTER
TO
PAY
THE
FAIR
PRICE
FOR
A
TOOL
OF
GOOD
TO
PUT
IT
IN
A
SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT
WAY
-
DO
NOT
ALLOW
YOURSELF
TO
BLAME
THE
TOOLS
WHEN
THE
JOB
DOES
NOT
TURN
OUT
QUITE
RIGHT
-
MANY
MEN
WITH
ONLY
LIMITED
ACCOMMODATION
HAVE
TO
DO
THEIR
WOODWORK
ON
THE
KITCHEN
TABLE
-
PROVIDING
THIS
IS
SOUND
-
SOME
PERFECTLY
GOOD
WORK
CAN
BE
DONE
ON
IT
-
BUT
THE
USUAL
PROBLEMS
PLACE
FOR
TOOLS
-
THE
COMBINED
BENCH
TOP
AND
TOOL
CUPBOARD
SHOWN
HERE
HAS
BEEN
SPECIALLY
DESIGNED
AND
MADE
FOR
WOODWORKER
READERS
WHO
HAVE
THIS
DIFFICULTY
-
HERE
IS
A
PROJECT
THAT
WILL
BE
WELCOMED
BY
THE
FAMILY
MAN
OR
FATHERTOBE
-
UNLIKE
MANY
COMMERCIAL
ARTICLES
-
THIS
CHAIR
IS
SOLIDLY
BUILT
AND
CAPABLE
OF
WITHSTANDING
THE
HEAVY
HANDLING
OF
THE
MOST
DESTRUCTIVE
YOUNGSTER
-
ALMOST
ANY
AVAILABLE
TIMBER
CAN
BE
USED
BUT
PARANA
PINE
IS
RECOMMENDED
-
BEING
CHEAP
-
EASY
TO
WORK
-
AND
TAKING
A
GOOD
FINISH
-
START
BY
MAKING
THE
TWO
SIDE
FRAMES
FROM
1
IN
BY
1
14
IN
PLANED
TIMBER
AS
SHOWN
IN
FIG
1
-
ALTHOUGH
THE
TIMBER
WILL
HAVE
ALREADY
BEEN
MACHINE
PLANED
-
REMEMBER
TO
GO
OVER
EACH
PIECE
WITH
A
SMOOTHING
PLANE
-
OTHERWISE
THE
MARKS
LEFT
BY
THE
CUTTERS
WILL
SHOW
UP
AFTER
PAINTING
-
THE
DIMENSIONS
GIVEN
ENABLE
THE
FEEDING
TRAY
TO
SLIDE
OVER
A
30
IN
TABLE
-
BUT
THE
HEIGHT
CAN
BE
ALTERED
IF
REQUIRED
-
ALL
THE
JOINTS
ARE
SIMPLE
HALVING
JOINTS
GLUED
AND
PINNED
-
WHICH
SHOULD
NEVERTHELESS
BE
CUT
WITH
CARE
TO
ENSURE
A
NEAT
CUT
TO
FIT
THEM
-
SEE
FIG
2
-
THESE
ARE
THEN
GLUED
AND
PINNED
INTO
PLACE
-
A
SIMILAR
PIECE
OF
1
IN
BY
1
14
IN
BY
14
IN
TIMBER
IS
FIXED
ACROSS
THE
END
OF
THE
FEEDING
TRAY
AS
SEEN
IN
FIG
3
WHICH
ALSO
SHOWS
HOW
A
PIECE
OF
HARDBOARD
IS
COVERED
WITH
PLASTIC
MATERIAL
FOR
EASY
CLEANING
AND
THEN
FIXED
UNDERNEATH
THE
FRAME
WITH
PANEL
PINS
TO
COMPLETE
THE
FEEDING
TRAY
-
CUT
THIS
PIECE
OF
HARDBOARD
SO
THAT
IT
FITS
UP
AGAINST
THE
FRONT
LEGS
OF
THE
CHAIR
-
THE
SEAT
RESTS
ACROSS
THE
UPPER
TWO
CROSS
PIECES
AND
IS
MADE
OF
12
IN
PLYWOOD
GLUED
AND
PANEL
PINNED
IN
POSITION
-
MEASUREMENTS
BEING
TAKEN
DIRECTLY
FROM
THE
WORK
-
FIG

SHOWS
THE
FRAMEWORK
FOR
THE
BACK
WHICH
THE
AMOUNT
OF
THE
BACKWARD
TILT
AND
ALSO
THE
HEIGHT
IS
LEFT
TO
PERSONAL
CHOICE
AND
THE
WIDTH
IS
BEST
TAKEN
DIRECTLY
FROM
THE
WORK
TO
ENSURE
A
GOOD
FIT
-
FIX
THE
PIECE
A
TO
THE
SIDES
FIRST
WITH
GLUE
AND
PANEL
PINS
AND
THEN
FIT
B
TEMPORARILY
IN
PLACE
ON
THE
CHAIR
FRAME
-
DECIDE
ON
THE
REQUIRED
ANGLE
OF
SLOPE
-
KEEPING
B
FLAT
ON
THE
CHAIR
SEAT
-
AND
MARK
OFF
THE
EXACT
POSITION
OF
B
ON
THE
SIDE
PIECES
-
THESE
CAN
THEN
BE
CUT
AT
THE
CORRECT
A
PIECE
OF
HARDBOARD
IS
THEN
CUT
AND
PINNED
TO
THE
FRAME
AND
ITS
EDGES
PLANED
OFF
FINALLY
ATTACH
THE
BACK
FIRMLY
TO
THE
SIDES
WITH
SCREWS
DRIVEN
FROM
THE
INSIDE
-
THE
FOOTREST
IS
A
BY
4
IN
ATTACHED
TO
THE
FRONT
LEGS
WITH
A
PAIR
OF
ANGLE
IRONS
AS
SHOWN
IN
FIG
5
-
WHEN
DETERMINING
TO
COMPLETE
THE
JOB
-
SCREW
TWO
FITTINGS
TO
THE
INSIDE
OF
THE
CHAIR
ARMS
ABOUT
2
12
IN
FROM
THE
MADE
BY
SHAPING
AND
SOLDERING
TWO
PIECES
OF
STOUT
WIRE
AS
SHOWN
IN
FIG
6
-
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THESE
ARE
WELL
SECURED
AS
THEY
WILL
HAVE
TO
WITHSTAND
CONSIDERABLE
PULLING
AS
THE
CHILD
BECOMES
OLDER
-
WITH
PLASTIC
WOOD
-
THEN
THOROUGHLY
GLASSPAPER
THE
WHOLE
WOODFILLER
IN
THE
USUAL
WAY
AND
PAINT
THE
FRAME
IN
A
SUITABLE
PASTEL
SHADE
-
USING
A
CONTRASTING
COLOUR
FOR
THE
SEAT
AND
THE
BACK
WHICH
CAN
BE
DECORATED
WITH
A
SUITABLE
NURSERY
TRANSFER
-
AVOID
USING
LEADBASED
PAINT
AS
THIS
COULD
PROVE
POISONOUS
IF
JUNIOR
DECIDES
TO
BITE
THE
CHAIR
-
FINALLY
-
IT
IS
AS
WELL
TO
COVER
THE
FOOTREST
WITH
RUBBER
OR
ANY
SUCH
PROTECTIVE
MATERIAL
THAT
MIGHT
BE
AVAILABLE
AS
OTHERWISE
THE
PAINT
WOULD
SOON
BE
SCRATCHED
OFF
-
SATISFYING
AND
WORTHWHILE
PROJECT
-
HERE
ARE
THE
PLANS
OF
A
VERY
SEAWORTHY
LITTLE
ROWING
DINGHY
MANY
OF
WHICH
I
HAVE
BUILT
AND
SOLD
-
IT
IS
ESPECIALLY
DESIGNED
FOR
SIMPLICITY
IN
CONSTRUCTION
-
CHEAPNESS
AND
LIGHTNESS
OF
WEIGHT
-
AND
MEASURES
APPROXIMATELY
8
FT
BY
4
FT
SHE
WEIGHS
ONLY
60
LB
BUT
CAN
CARRY
THREE
PEOPLE
AND
AN
OUTBOARD
MOTOR
WITH
A
COMFORTABLE
MARGIN
OF
FREEBOARD
-
FOR
INSTANCE
-
IN
CANADA
WE
USE
GALVANISED
NAILS
IN
PLACE
OF
SCREWS
-
WE
JUST
BEND
THEM
OVER
AND
CLAMP
ALWAYS
USED
BRASS
SCREWS
-
WHICH
ARE
MORE
EXPENSIVE
-
THE
FIRST
IS
NAILED
AND
GLUED
TOGETHER
STRONGLY
-
IT
MAY
BE
MARKED
AND
CUT
TO
SHAPE
LATER
-
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
WOODEN
FLOOR
ON
WHICH
TO
ANCHOR
THE
MOULDS
-
MAKE
A
FRAME
OF
ROUGH
LUMBER
AS
SHOWN
IN
FIG
2
-
THE
MAIN
IDEA
IS
TO
HAVE
THE
MOULDS
STANDING
AS
RIGID
AS
POSSIBLE
-
FOR
IT
IS
ON
THESE
YOU
WILL
BE
BUILDING
AND
SHAPING
YOUR
LITTLE
CRAFT
-
UPSIDEDOWN
-
FOR
CHEAPNESS
I
RECOMMEND
USING
DOUGLAS
FIR
PLYWOOD
FROM
BRITISH
COLUMBIA
-
THIS
IS
HOT
PRESSED
AND
RESIN
BONDED
TO
ENSURE
A
PERMANENTLY
WATER
PROOF
GLUE
LINE
-
BE
SURE
TO
MAHOGANY
TABLE
WHICH
I
BOUGHT
AT
A
SALE
FOR
ONE
SHILLING
-
I
HAVE
ALSO
INCLUDED
A
SKETCH
OF
PADDLES
I
MAKE
FOR
AND
EASY
TO
MAKE
-
AS
WILL
BE
SEEN
FROM
THE
PLAN
THERE
IS
ONLY
A
SINGLE
GUNWALE
ON
THE
OUTSIDE
-
I
FIND
THAT
THE
TYPE
OF
ROWLOCK
WE
USE
IN
CANADA
CUT
THE
MOULDS
AND
THE
TRANSOMS
TO
SHAPE
AS
IN
THE
DETAILED
DRAWINGS
-
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
WOODEN
FLOOR
YOU
CAN
USE
IF
NOT
-
USE
A
STRONG
HORIZONTAL
THE
GROUND
OR
CONCRETE
FLOOR
-
I
USE
A
HEAVY
OLD
BASE
AS
IN
FIG
2
-
THE
EDGES
OF
THE
TRANSOMS
SHOULD
BE
BEVELLED
TO
CORRESPOND
TO
THE
SIDES
AND
BOTTOM
OF
THE
BOAT
-
DONT
FORGET
TO
CUT
OUT
ON
EACH
SIDE
OF
EACH
MOULD
TO
ALLOW
FOR
THE
CHINES
TO
REST
IN
THESE
NOTCHES
-
AS
THEY
ARE
NOT
FASTENED
TO
THE
MOULDS
-
WHICH
WILL
ONLY
BE
USED
WHILST
THE
HULL
IS
UNDER
CONSTRUCTION
-
THE
CHINE
IS
THE
LONG
STRINGER
ON
EACH
SIDE
WHICH
ASH
-
SPRUCE
OR
ANY
LONG
GRAINED
FLEXIBLE
WOOD
-
I
PREFER
SPRUCE
WHEN
AVAILABLE
-
AS
WILL
BE
SEEN
ON
EACH
SIDE
-
THE
CHINES
ARE
MORTICED
INTO
THIS
AND
BUTT
UP
AGAINST
THE
TRANSOM
-
START
AT
THE
BOW
AND
SPRING
THEM
BOTH
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
OVER
THE
SLOTS
CUT
IN
THE
MOULDS
AND
INTO
THE
NOTCHES
CUT
FOR
THIS
PURPOSE
IN
THE
STERN
OR
AFTER
THE
SKELETON
OF
THE
BOAT
WILL
NOW
TAKE
SHAPE
-
AND
THIS
IS
THE
TIME
TO
CHECK
BEFORE
MAKING
FAST
TO
SEE
THAT
NOTHING
IS
DISTORTED
-
ENSURE
THAT
THE
OUTSIDE
MEASUREMENTS
FROM
TRANSOM
TO
TRANSOM
ARE
EQUAL
ON
EACH
SIDE
AND
THAT
THE
TRANSOMS
ARE
PARALLEL
HORIZONTALLY
-
NEXT
BEVEL
THE
CHINES
WITH
A
PLANE
SO
THAT
THE
BOTTOM
WILL
FIT
SNUGLY
-
CUT
OUT
THE
BOTTOM
AND
SIDES
ACCURATELY
FROM
THE
PLAN
MEASUREMENTS
BUT
LEAVE
SUFFICIENT
MARGIN
FOR
PLANING
AFTER
FIXING
TO
THE
BOAT
-
USE
YOUR
TWO
LENGTHS
OF
8
FT
BY
4
FT
PLY
FOR
THIS
PURPOSE
-
THE
SIDES
FROM
ONE
-
AND
THE
BOTTOM
FROM
THE
OTHER
-
IF
CARE
IS
TAKEN
NOT
TO
WASTE
THE
PLY
-
PLENTY
OF
MATERIAL
IS
LEFT
OVER
FOR
THE
THWARTS
-
HAVING
TRIMMED
UP
THE
CHINES
-
WE
ARE
NOW
READY
TO
PLANK
THE
SIDES
-
START
AGAIN
AT
THE
BOWS
-
ROUND
THE
FRAME
TO
THE
STERN
AND
CLAMP
THERE
-
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
THIRD
CLAMP
USE
IT
IN
THE
CENTRE
AS
WELL
-
AFTER
GENEROUSLY
COVERING
WITH
GLUE
-
SCREW
THE
SIDES
TO
THE
TRANSOM
FRAMING
AND
THE
CHINE
-
USE
58
BY
NO
4
GAUGE
SCREWS
-
BRASS
-
OR
NAIL
WITH
INCH
AND
A
QUARTER
GALVANIZED
NAILS
-
IF
YOU
ARE
DOING
IT
THAT
WAY
-
USE
FLAT
HEAD
SCREWS
THE
14
IN
PLY
-
MAKE
A
VERY
SMALL
HOLE
FOR
THE
SCREW
TO
ALLOW
FOR
A
GOOD
GRIP
-
REMEMBER
TO
GLUE
BEFORE
SCREWING
-
CLEAN
UP
WITH
THE
PLANE
READY
FOR
THE
BOTTOM
-
TRIFLE
-
THIS
CAN
BE
CLEANED
UP
LATER
-
AS
YOU
ARE
SCREWING
AND
GLUING
THIS
PIECE
TO
THE
CHINES
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
BE
CAREFUL
NOT
TO
MISS
THE
CHINE
WITH
THE
SCREWS
-
I
PREFER
SPACING
SCREWS
3
IN
APART
FOR
THE
BOTTOM
-
BOTH
FOR
SCREWING
TO
THE
CHINES
AND
THE
BOTTOM
SHAPED
TRANSOM
FACING
-
THE
RUBBING
STRAKES
AND
YOU
ARE
READY
TO
LIFT
THE
BOAT
OFF
THE
MOULDS
-
YOU
WONT
WANT
THEM
AGAIN
FOR
THIS
BOAT
-
SO
SHIFT
THEM
RIGHT
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
-
PLACE
THE
BOAT
RIGHT
SIDE
UP
ON
TWO
BOXES
OR
TRESTLES
OF
CONVENIENT
HEIGHT
FOR
TAKING
CARE
TO
REINFORCE
THE
SIDES
OF
THE
DINGHY
AT
THE
SEATS
WITH
VERTICAL
MEMBERS
AS
SHOWN
IN
THE
PLANS
-
MAKE
THE
BEFORE
RIVETING
ON
THE
GUNWALES
SO
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
PUT
ONE
TO
FIT
THE
BLOCK
-
I
RIVET
MY
GUNWALES
TOGETHER
THROUGH
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
HULL
WITH
COPPER
NAILS
AND
ROVES
-
IT
GREATLY
IMPROVES
THE
UNDERCOAT
AND
AT
LEAST
ONE
COAT
OF
FINISHING
PAINT
-
WHEN
AN
ASSORTMENT
OF
DIFFERENTLY
COLOURED
MATERIALS
ARE
CUT
INTO
A
VARIETY
OF
SHAPES
THEY
CAN
BE
COMBINED
BY
EITHER
WHILE
THESE
MAY
ULTIMATELY
BE
MADE
INTO
A
PICTURE
FOR
FRAMING
AND
HANGING
ON
A
WALL
-
THEY
MAY
ALSO
BE
ARRANGED
INTO
A
DESIGN
-
AND
THE
RESULTING
PANEL
UTILIZED
FOR
DECORATING
A
USEFUL
ARTICLE
-
THIS
COULD
HARDLY
HAPPEN
WITHOUT
THE
HERRING
HAVING
SOME
ORIENTATION
WITH
THE
SEA
BOTTOM
-
IT
MEANS
THAT
THE
CROWDING
IS
CAUSED
DURING
THE
DAYTIME
-
AND
THAT
THE
HERRING
MUST
CONTINUE
TO
MIGRATE
OVER
THE
GROUND
AS
WELL
AS
IN
MIDWATER
AND
DURING
THE
SWIM

GEOGRAPHY

TOO

THE
GREAT

THAT
DEPEND
ON
THEM
-
THE
HERRING
SPAWN
ALONG
THE

THE
EFFECT
OF

CONGESTION
DUE
TO
THE

PRESSURE
IS
INEVITABLY
MIXED
WITH
THAT
OF
THE
SUITABILITY
OF

FOR

-
BOTH
RESULT
IN

SO
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
TO
TRY
TO
SEPARATE
THEM
-
THANK
HEAVEN
-
A
GOOD
PICTURE
OF
THIS
IS
SEEN
ON
THE
150
MILES
OF
SPAWNING
GROUNDS
FROM
THE
VIKING
IN
THE
NORTH
DOWN
TO
THE
KLONDYKES
AND
THE
REEF
ALONG
THE
WESTERN
EDGE
OF
THE
NORWEGIAN
DEEP
-
IN
THIS
200FATHOM
TRENCH
THE
HERRING
DO
NOT
TOUCH
THE
BOTTOM
-
THEIR
DESCENT
STOPS
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
LIGHT
PRESSURE
-
BUT
THEY
MIGRATE
EASTERLY
TO
THE
NORWEGIAN
SIDE
-
OR
WESTERLY
-
UNTIL
IN
THE
SHALLOWER
WATER
THE
MILE
WIDE
LAYERS
DISAPPEAR
FROM
THE
ECHOSOUNDERS
-
BOTTOM
CROWDING
COMES
WHEN
THEY
CANNOT
REACH
THEIR
OPTIMUM
DEPTH
-
AND
THIS
COINCIDES
WITH
THE
SUITABLE
GRAVELLY
SOIL
OF
THESE
MANY
ROUGHS
WHERE
THE
SPRING
SPAWNING
HERRING
ARE
ALWAYS
FOUND
-
AND
FISHING
GEAR
LEADS
TO
AN
OVERALL
THOUGH
SOMEWHAT
DIM
PICTURE
-
THE
DETAILS
ARE
HARDER
STILL
TO
SEE
-
SHOALS
THAT
GATHER
AT
THE
KNOLL
OR
OTHER
BANKS
ARE
MOST
OF
THEM
GOING
TO
TRAVEL
A
HUNDRED
MILES
FARTHER
SOUTH
BEFORE
THEY
SPAWN
-
SOME
WILL
SPAWN
AT
THE
SO
THE
ARRIVAL
OF
ANY
PARTICULAR
SHOAL
FISH
AT
A
CERTAIN
SPAWNING
GROUND
MAY
BE
ACCIDENTAL
-
YET
THERE
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
SOME
THAT
FIND
IT
IF
ENOUGH
ARE
TRAVELLING
-
JUST
AS
THE
ROBIN
WHO
GETS
BACK
EXACTLY
MAY
BE
ONLY
ONE
AMONG
THOUSANDS
WHO
DO
NOT
-
BUT
THIS
SOUTHERLY
MIGRATION
IS
NOT
ACCIDENTAL
-
BEING
CONTRANATANT
OR
AGAINST
THE
DRIFT
-
IT
PROBABLY
HAS
A
SURVIVAL
VALUE
IN
ENSURING
THAT
THE
FRY
AFTER
HATCHING
ARE
DRIFTED
BACK
INTO
THE
NORMAL
HOME
EXPLAINS
HOW
THESE
MIGRATING
HERRING
ARE
BIASED
TO
EAST
OR
WEST
BY
THE
DIFFERENT

STRONG
WESTERLIES
ARE
WELL
KNOWN
TO
BRING
GOOD
LONGSHORE

THE
SURFACE
WATER
THAT
IS
BLOWN
OFFSHORE
MUST
BE
REPLACED
BY
AN
UNDERFLOW
BRINGING
WITH
IT
THE

TO
THE
NORFOLK

SUFFOLK
BEACHES
-
EASTERLY
WINDS
-
ON
THE
OTHER

RECENT
YEARS
HAVE
SHOWN

A
SUCCESSION
OF

IS
NEEDED
FOR
THIS
EFFECT
OF

-
ONE
BREEZE
WILL
NOT
DO
IT

BUT
QUITE
APART
FROM
THIS

EFFECT
THERE
IS
AN
EASTERLY
DRIFT
SPECIAL
TO
THIS

CAUSED
BY

CALL
THIS

THE

IT
IS

AT

TIDES

YOU
WILL

OF

A

OF

ALMOST
A

ON
EVERY

AT
THE

KNOLL
-
WITHOUT
AN
EXPLANATION
OF
HOW
IT
TO
THE
MOUTH
OF
A
GREAT
SALMON
RIVER
-
HAS
BEEN
THE
BIGGEST
FACTOR
THROUGH
THE
AGES
IN
THE
CONSTANCY
OF
THIS
GREAT
HERRING
FISHERY
-
THE
EAST
ANGLIAN
BEHAVIOUR
-
SEE
P

-
HAS
ALWAYS
DIFFERED
FROM
THAT
OF
THE
SUMMER
FISHERIES
-
THERE
IS
THE
-
SWIM
-
AT
SLACK
WATERS
-
EVEN
IN
DAYLIGHT
SOMETIMES
-
AND
THE
HIGH
SWIMMING
-
WHEN

ARE
CAUGHT
ONLY
IN
THE
TOP
FEW
YARDS
OF
NETTING
-
THESE
AND
OTHER
FASCINATING
BEHAVIOUR
MYSTERIES
ARE
PECULIAR
TO
THIS
FISHERY
-
WHICH
UNFORTUNATELY
SEEMS
TO
BE
DYING
OUT
-
BUT
A
FULL
DISCUSSION
OF
THEM
IS
BEYOND
THE
PRESENT
SCOPE
-
THE
BOWWAVE
THEORY
-
THIS
ASSUMES
THAT
ALL
FISHING
GEAR
-
WHEN
MOVING
-
SENDS
BEFORE
IT
A
KIND
OF
SCARING
EFFECT
-
PROBABLY
THROUGH
WAVES
OR
VIBRATIONS
IN

ALONG

SUGGEST
THAT
THE
FOOTROPE
OF
A

DOES
THIS

FILMS
HAVE
ALSO
SHOWN
PLAICE
MOVING
BEFORE

JUST
THE

AFTER

GATHERED

-
OR
EVEN
IN
THE
CASE
OF
FLAT

-
BY
VIBRATIONS
THROUGH
OR
ALONG
THE
BOTTOM
-
-
BUT
GIVEN
SUCH
A
BOW
WAVE
OF
DISTURBANCE
-
IT
IS
OBVIOUS
THAT
WITHOUT
SOMETHING
LET
US
CONSIDER
FIRST
WHAT
WOULD
APPEAR
TO
BE
THE
SIMPLEST
CASE
-
THAT
OF
FLAT
FISH
ON
THE
BOTTOM
-
THE
EVIDENCE
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
FISH
ARE
AWARE
OF
THE
MOVING
FOOTROPE
BEFORE
IT
-
SWIMMING
AT
THE
SAME
SPEED
FOR
AN
UNKNOWN
PERIOD
OF
TIME
-
UNTIL
THEN
THEY
STOP
SWIMMING
AND
ARE
CAUGHT
-
IN
THE
SEINENET
FILM
THIS
USUALLY
SEEMED
TO
HAPPEN
JUST
AFTER
THE

HAD
RISEN
ABOVE
THE
FOOTROPE
-
AND
PRESUMABLY
OUT
OF
ITS
FIELD
OF
DISTURBANCE
-
OR
BOW
WAVE
-
THIS
SUGGESTS
THAT
THE
WAVE
MIGHT
BE
TRANSMITTED
BY
THE
SEABED
-
THOUGH
THE
FOOTROPE
IN
THIS
CASE
WAS
ACTUALLY
JUST
OFF
THE
BOTTOM
AND
WAS
INDEED
PASSING
OVER
SOME
FISH
-
ACTUALLY
THE
SEINE
NET
HAS
LITTLE
OR
NO
COVER
-
AND
IN
THIS
FILM
THE
RISE
OF
THE
FISH
WAS
SMALL
-
A
MATTER
OF
A
FOOT
OR
TWO
-
WITH
ROUND
FISH
LIKE
HADDOCK
-
WHICH
WOULD
HARDLY
WOULD
SEEM
TO
BE

PROVE
THIS

SENT

ON

-
ONLY
TWO
OR
THREE
SURVIVED
THE
JOURNEY
-
ONE
THRIVED
AND
THE
LATEST
REPORT
I
HAVE
IS
THAT
THIS
MANTIS
IS
STILL
ALIVE
-
DESPITE
THE
STEADY
INFLUX
OF
SUBSTITUTES
SINCE
THE
END
OF
THE
WAR
-
CLAY
POTS
ARE
STILL
IN
GREATEST
DEMAND
-
IT
IS
MOSTLY
IN
THE
SMALLER
SIZES
THAT
THE
SUBSTITUTES
HAVE
MADE
HEADWAY
-
AND
ALTHOUGH
NUMEROUS
SMALL
CLAY
POTS
ARE
USED
EACH
YEAR
-
THEY
ARE
FEWER
THAN
THEY
WERE
10
NO
REAL
SUBSTITUTE
FOR
CLAY
THAT
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
AT
A
COMPARABLE
PRICE
-
EXCEPT
THE
BITUMINIZED
PAPER
POTS
WHICH
ARE
USED
ON
COMMERCIAL
NURSERIES
FOR
GROWING
TOMATOES
THE
MAIN
DISADVANTAGE
OF
THE
CLAY
POT
IS
ITS
BRITTLE
NATURE
-
EVEN
WITH
REASONABLY
CAREFUL
HANDLING
-
THE
ANNUAL
LOSSES
ARE
OFTEN
AROUND
10
PER
CENT
-
AND
WHERE
THE
HANDLING
AND
STORAGE
FACILITIES
ARE
NOT
TOO
GOOD
-
THESE
LOSSES
WILL
BE
EVEN
GREATER
-
THIS
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
APPLY
TO
THE
LARGER
SIZES
-
AS
THEY
ARE
NOT
QUITE
SO
FRAGILE
AS
THE
ABOUT
IN
QUITE
THE
SAME
WAY
-
DEFINITE
DISADVANTAGE
-
THEY
ARE
FAIRLY
HEAVY
AND
DIFFICULT
THINGS
TO
ACCOMMODATE
AND
THEY
MUST
HAVE
SOME
PROTECTION
FROM
SEVERE
WEATHER
-
WHICH
CAN
BE
QUITE
A
HEADACHE
IN
BROKEN
POTS
HAVE
ON
OCCASIONS
PROVIDED
ARTISTS
WITH
DELIGHTFUL
STUDIES
-
THERE
IS
NO
DOUBT
THAT
A
PILE
OF
BADLY
STACKED
-
HALFBROKEN
POTS
IS
AN
UNLOVELY
SIGHT
FROM
ANY
POINT
OF
VIEW
-
EVERY
GARDEN
BOY
WILL
AGREE
THAT
HAVING
TO
WASH
CLAY
POTS
IS
A
DEFINITE
FACTOR
IN
FAVOUR
OF
THEIR
ABOLITION
-
IN
FACT
ONE
YOUNG
MAN
WAS
SO
WHOLEHEARTED
ABOUT
THIS
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
THAT
HE
MADE
THE
HEADLINES
FOR
HAVING
SMASHED
A
LARGE
NUMBER
-
TO
RELIEVE
HIS
FEELINGS
-
ON
THE
SMALLTOMEDIUM
ESTABLISHMENT
-
IT
IS
A
DISAGREEABLE
CHORE
WHICH
NOBODY
TACKLES
WITH
ANY
ENTHUSIASM
-
WHEREAS
ON
LARGER
ESTABLISHMENTS
THE
POTS
CAN
BE
STERILIZED
OR
WASHED
BY
MACHINE
-
IT
IS
NOT
EASY
TO
MAKE
AN
ECONOMIC
COMPARISON
BETWEEN
CLAY
POTS
AND
THE
VARIOUS
SUBSTITUTES
-
THE
FORMER
MAY
LAST
INDEFINITELY
WITH
LUCK
-
WHILE
THE
LATTER
ARE
OFTEN
EXPENDABLE
USED
ONLY
ONCE
-
CLAY
POTS
ARE
EFFICIENT
AND
CONGENIAL
CONTAINERS
IN
WHICH
TO
GROW
PLANTS
-
IN
THEIR
PROPER
SETTING
THEY
ARE
NOT
UNATTRACTIVE
AND
-
IN
SPITE
OF
THEIR
SHORTCOMINGS
-
MOST
GARDENERS
HAVE
A
NOSTALGIC
AFFECTION
FOR
THEM
-
PRESENTDAY
POTS
ARE
BETTER
FINISHED
-
DO
WASH
-
THE
DEEP
RIMS
MAKE
FOR
NEATER
AND
SAFER
STACKING
-
THOUGH
THEY
ARE
STILL
EXPENSIVE
AND
STILL
GET
BROKEN
-
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
-
THERE
IS
REALLY
NO
REPLACEMENT
FOR
THE
LARGER
SIZES
-
SO
THEY
HAVE
THE
DECIDED
ADVANTAGE
OF
BEING
THE
ONLY
SUITABLE
CONTAINER
AVAILABLE
IN
QUANTITY
FOR
FAIRLY
LARGE
PLANTS
-
SOIL
BLOCKS
ARE
PROBABLY
THE
OLDEST
ALTERNATIVE
TO
CLAY
POTS
FOR
PLANT
RAISING
-
THESE
ARE
COMPRESSED
BLOCKS
OF
COMPOST
-
MADE
IN
A
SPECIALLY
DEVISED
PRESS
TO
SIMULATE
ROUGHLY
THE
SHAPE
AND
SIZE
OF
A
POT
-
USUALLY
CYLINDRICAL
OR
HEXAGONAL
IN

-
THEY
ARE
MADE
OF
THE
SAME
COMPOST
AS
WOULD
HAVE
THAT
IT
IS
USED
IN
A
SLIGHTLY
MOISTER
SEED
IS
SOWN
-
OR
SEEDLINGS
ARE
PRICKED
OUT
INTO
THEM
IN
THE
NORMAL
WAY
-
THE
ONLY
REAL
DIFFERENCE
BEING
THAT
MORE
OF
THE
WATERING
IS
DONE
THROUGH
A
ROSE
TO
AVOID
BREAKING
THE
BLOCKS
WITH
A
SPOUT
OF
WATER
-
FIRSTCLASS
PLANTS
OF
TOMATOES
-
CUCUMBERS
-
MARROWS
-
MELONS
-
CAULIFLOWERS
-
CELERY
AND
ONIONS
-
MAY
ALL
BE
RAISED
IN
SOIL
BLOCKS
-
SO
CAN
SUCH
FLOWERING
PLANTS
AS
DAHLIAS
-
CHRYSANTHEMUMS
-
SALVIAS
-
SWEET
PEAS
-
LUPINS
AND
NUMEROUS
OTHERS
-
ONE
BIG
ADVANTAGE
OF
SOIL
BLOCKS
IS
AN
OBVIOUS
ONE
-
THE
COST
OF
A
POT
OF
ANY
DESCRIPTION
IS
SAVED
COMPLETELY
-
MANUFACTURING
THE
BLOCK
AND
PLANTING
IT
IS
VERY
LITTLE
MORE
TROUBLE
THAN
NORMAL
POTTING
-
AND
A
SUPERIOR
PLANT
-
WHICH
TRANSPLANTS
MORE
EASILY
-
IS
PRODUCED
-
THE
OBVIOUS
LIMITATION
-
IS
THAT
SOIL
BLOCKS
CAN
ONLY
BE
USED
FOR
PROPAGATING
-
THERE
CAN
BE
NO
PROGRESSION
TO
A
LARGER
BLOCK
WHEN
THE
PLANT
OR
SEEDLING
IS
READY
TO
BE
MOVED
-
IT
MUST
BE
PLANTED
OUT
OR
POTTED
-
MANY
AMATEUR
GARDENERS
MIGHT
IMPROVE
THEIR
RESULTS
BY
BUYING
A
SMALL
HANDOPERATED
SOIL
BLOCK
MAKER
AND
USE
THE
MONEY
SAVED
ON
BUYING
SMALL
POTS
TO
IMPROVE
THEIR
COMPOSTS
-
THE
VARIOUS
TYPES
OF
SMALL
PAPER
POTS
ARE
VERY
USEFUL
FOR
SHORTTERM
OPERATIONS
-
BUT
ARE
INCLINED
TO
COLLAPSE
IF
THE
PLANTS
ARE
IN
THEM
TOO
LONG
-
THEY
ARE
-
QUITE
USEFUL
FOR
PLANTS
THAT
ARE
DESPATCHED
TO
MARKET
OR
DIRECT
TO
CUSTOMERS
-
THEIR
CHEAPNESS
MAKING
THEM
ATTRACTIVE
TO
THE
IN
CARRIAGE
COSTS
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
LIGHTNESS
-
THERE
ARE
MANY
TYPES
OF
PLASTIC
POTS
AVAILABLE
-
SOME
EXPENSIVE
-
SOME
QUITE
CHEAP
-
SOME
GOOD
AND
OTHERS
NOT
SO
GOOD
-
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
PLANTS
GROW
QUITE
WELL
IN
PLASTIC
POTS
AND
USUALLY
NEED
LESS
WATER
THAN
THOSE
IN
CLAY
POTS
-
THEY
ARE
SLIGHTLY
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
MANAGE
-
HOWEVER
-
UNTIL
A
LITTLE
EXPERIENCE
HAS
BEEN
GAINED
WITH
THEM
-
PLASTIC
POTS
ARE
USUALLY
MORE
EXPENSIVE
THAN
CLAY
ONES
-
BUT
THEY
ARE
ALMOST
INDESTRUCTIBLE
AND
WILL
LAST
A
LONG
TIME
WITH
NORMAL
CARE

HOW
TO

HE

YOU

MANY
OF

OF

FOR
THE

ARE
THERE
ANY

AT

IT
WAS

THAT

THESE

WERE

BUT
THIS
VIEW
LED
TO
TOO
MANY
DIFFICULTIES
AND
WAS
FINALLY
ABANDONED
-
NEVERTHELESS
THE
SEARCH
FOR
BASIC
UNITS
OF
MIND
HAS
GONE
ON
AND
WILL
DOUBTLESS
CONTINUE
-
FOR
IT
IS
THE
AIM
OF
SCIENCE
TO
DISCOVER
ULTIMATE
UNITS
-
SCIENCES
-
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
SUCCESS
OF
THE
ATOMIC
THEORY
IN
PHYSICS
MIGHT
LEAD
US
TO
SUPPOSE
THAT
THE
ULTIMATE
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
MANY
CONFLICTING
TENDENCIES
IN
PSYCHOLOGY
IN
ITS
SEARCH
FOR
ULTIMATE
UNITS
AND
HERE
WE
CAN
ONLY
INDICATE
WHAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
MOST
PROMISING
CONCRETE
IT
WILL
BE
AT
THE
COST
OF
OVERSIMPLIFICATION
IT
IS
THE
TENDENCY
TO
GET
THINGS
THE
WRONG
WAY
ROUND
-
AS
A
PSYCHOLOGIST
I
AM
CONSTANTLY
ENCOUNTERING
THIS
TENDENCY
IN
FRIENDS
AND
ACQUAINTANCES
-
THEY
THINK
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
INEVITABLY
-
QUEER
-
ABOUT
PSYCHOLOGY
AND
THIS
FEELING
OF
QUEERNESS
USUALLY
BOILS
DOWN
TO
A
QUITE
MISTAKEN
BELIEF
THAT
THE
PSYCHOLOGIST
FIRST
LOOKS
INTO
-
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
MEAN
BY
-
GETTING
THINGS
THE
WRONG
WAY
HIS
OWN
MIND
WORKS
BY
LOOKING
AT
OTHER
PEOPLES
-
FOR
ALTHOUGH
LOOKING
INWARDS
-
OR
-
INTROSPECTING
-
AS
IT
IS
CALLED
-
-
IS
NOT
ENTIRELY
RULED
OUT
-
NOWADAYS
MOST
PSYCHOLOGISTS
WOULD
AGREE
THAT
IT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
UNRELIABLE
METHODS
OF
GETTING
ANY
PRECISE
INFORMATION
-
DIRECTLY
LOOK
INTO
THE
MENTAL
PROCESSES
OF
ANOTHER
PERSON
THEY
OBSERVE
HIS
VISIBLE
BEHAVIOUR
AND
THEN
TRY
TO
GIVE
THEORETICAL
INTERPRETATIONS
OF
WHAT
LIES
BEHIND
THIS
BEHAVIOUR
-
THIS
IS
NO
MORE
QUEER
THAN
THE
METHOD
OF
THE
DOCTOR
WHO
OBSERVES
SIGNS
-
AND
RECORDS
SYMPTOMS
-
AND
DIAGNOSES
THE
INNER
STATES
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THEM
-
HE
MAY
NEVER
HAVE
HAD
THE
DISEASE
HIMSELF
BUT
HE
CAN
NEVERTHELESS
IDENTIFY
IT
-
SIMILARLY
THE
PSYCHOLOGIST
HAS
TO
BE
PREPARED
TO
OBSERVE
AND
MAKE
INFERENCES
ABOUT
ALL
KINDS
OF
PROCESSES
IN
OTHER
PEOPLE
-
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
CORRESPOND
WITH
ANYTHING
IN
HIS

LITTLE
ABOUT

THE

AND

OF

HELD
IN

REFLECTED
NOT

AN

AWARENESS

IN

IT
WAS
SUGGESTED
BY

BANKS
-
ASSISTANT
DIRECTOR
OF
EDUCATION
FOR

-
THAT
INDUSTRIAL
FIRMS
MIGHT
BE
READY
FOR

-
THEIR

PAID
FOR
THE
TIME
THUS
SPENT
-
AN
APPROACH
WAS
MADE
TO
ABOUT
TWENTY
LARGE
FIRMS
AND
IN

TOBER
-
1959
-
THE
FIRST
EXPERIMENTAL
DAYRELEASE
COURSE
FOR
MEN
WAS
ORGANISED
-
ELEVEN
STUDENTS
FROM
SEVEN
FIRMS
ATTEN
DED
A
COURSE
ON
SIX
FULL
FRIDAYS
AND
IT
WAS
MADE
CLEAR
BOTH
TO
THE
MEN
AND
THEIR
EMPLOYERS
THAT
THE
VENTURE
WAS
AN
EXPERIMENT
FROM
WHICH
THE
ORGANISERS
HOPED
TO
LEARN
AS
MUCH
AS
THE
PARTICIPANTS
-
1
-
ARE
THERE
DIFFERENCES
IN
ADJUSTMENT
TO
AGEING
AND
RETIREMENT
ACCORDING
TO
THE
OCCUPATIONAL
LEVEL
OF
EMPLOYEES
-
2
-
IF
SO
-
WHICH
OCCUPATIONAL
LEVELS
ARE
THE
BETTER
OR
THE
POORER
PREPARED
FOR
SUCCESSFUL
ADJUSTMENT
TO
RETIREMENT
AND
IN
WHAT
ASPECTS
-

-
DOES
THE
EVIDENCE
OBTAINED
SUPPORT
A
RATIONALE
FOR
ADAPTING
A
PRERETIREMENT
PLANNING
AND
PREPARATION
PROGRAMME
TO
THE
NEEDS
OF
OLDER
EMPLOYEES
OF
DIFFERENT
OCCUPATIONAL
LEVELS
-
EACH
TIME
YOU
REHEARSE
YOU
WILL
PROBABLY
PUT
THINGS
IN
A
DIFFERENT
WAY
-
ALL
THE
BETTER
-
-
IT
WILL
SOUND
MUCH
MORE
SPONTANEOUS
ON
THE
OCCASION
ITSELF
-
REMEMBER
YOUR
FOUR
NAMES
-
HAVE
THE
LIST
WITH
YOU
IF
YOU
LIKE
-
AND
YOU
SIMPLY
CANT
BE
FLUMMOXED
-
OF
COURSE
-
IN
ANY
SPEECH
A
GOOD
START
AND
A
GOOD
FINISH
ARE
HALF
THE
BATTLE
-
SO
-
SEE
THE
NEXT
PAGE
-
YES
-
THEY
ARE
WAITING
FOR
YOU
-
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
TO
BE
FRIGHTENED
-
THE
AUDIENCE
WILL
EAT
OUT
OF
YOUR
HAND
-
IF
THEY
LIKE
WHAT
YOU
OFFER
THEM
-
A
GOOD
START
WILL
PUT
THEM
IN
A
GOOD
HUMOUR
-
LADIES
AND
GENTLEMEN
-
I
M
AFRAID
I
HAVE
NOT
HAD
MUCH
EXPERIENCE
OF
PUBLIC
SPEAKING
-
BUT
THAT
S
A
TERRIBLE
WAY
TO
BEGIN
-
WHY
TELL
THEM
YOU
ARE
A
NOVICE
-
IT
S
THEIR
INTEREST
YOU
WANT
-
NOT
THEIR
SYMPATHY
-
AND
YOU
WANT
TO
GET
IT
FROM
THE
WORD
VISION
KEEPS
PEOPLE
AT
HOME
-
BUT
YOU
-
AT
ANY
RATE
-
HAVE
PROVED
THAT
WRONG
-
AND
THEY
SAY
-
TOO
-
THAT
TELEVISION
MAKES
ITS
APPEAL
TO
THOSE
OF
LESSER
MAY
I
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
HAVE
PROVED
THAT
RIGHT
-
CONGRATULATIONS
-
AND
AWAY
YOU
GO
INTO
YOUR
SPEECH
-
TAKE
SOME
THOUGHT
-
TOO
-
FOR
YOUR
ENDING
-
THANK
YOU
FOR
LISTENING
TO
ME
SO
PATIENTLY
-
A
POLITICAL
CANDIDATE
OFTEN
USED
THAT
FINISH
-
NO
WONDER
HE
DIDNT
GET
IN
-
INSTEAD
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
ENDED
THIS
WAY
-
WELL
-
THOSE
ARE
MY
VIEWS
-
WHEN
HE
LEARNED
WHAT
WAS
CAUSING
THE
COMMOTION
HE
BECAME
GREATLY
ALARMED
-
AND
AFTER
THE
BODY
HAD
BEEN
TAKEN
TO
ST
THOMASS
HOSPITAL
IT
WAS
HIS
GRIEFSTRICKEN
DUTY
FORMALLY
TO
IDENTIFY
ELIZABETH
CAMP
-
AGED
THIRTYTHREE
-
THE
GIRL
WHO
WAS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
HIS
BRIDE
-
THERE
WAS
LITTLE
DOUBT
OF
HOW
SHE
HAD
MET
HER
DEATH
-
AND
EVEN
LESS
THAT
IT
HAD
BEEN
MURDER
-
SHE
HAD
BEEN
STRUCK
SEVERAL
TIMES
WITH
A
BLUNT
INSTRUMENT
-
AND
HER
HEAD
WAS
SMASHED
IN
-
THERE
WERE
SIGNS
OF
A
VIOLENT
STRUGGLE
-
BLOOD
OF
HER
BROKEN
UMBRELLA
-
BUT
A
PAIR
OF
BONE
CUFFLINKS
FOUND
IN
THE
COMPARTMENT
SEEMED
TO
PROVIDE
THE
ONLY
POSSIBLE
CLUE
TO
THE
KILLER
-
THE
BODY
WAS
EXAMINED
-
AND
IT
WAS
DEFINITELY
ESTABLISHED
THAT
NO
SEXUAL
ASSAULT
HAD
TAKEN
PLACE
-
IT
SEEMED
PROBABLE
THAT
THE
MOTIVE
HAD
BEEN
ROBBERY
-
AND
THIS
WAS
FURTHER
CONFIRMED
WHEN
A
CHECK
WAS
MADE
WITH
THE
WOMANS
RELATIONS
IN
HOUNSLOW
-
MISS
CAMP
HAD
BEEN
THE
HOUSEKEEPER
AT
THE
GOOD
INTENT
-
A
PUBLICHOUSE
IN
WALWORTH
-
HER
DAY
OFF
WAS
THURSDAY
-
AND
BEFORE
COMING
UP
TO
LONDON
IN
THE
EVENING
SHE
HAD
CALLED
ON
HER
TWO
SISTERS
-
ONE
OF
WHOM
LIVED
AT
HAMMERSMITH
AND
THE
ELIZABETH
HAD
LEFT
HAMMERSMITH
IN
THE
LATE
AFTERNOON
-
SHE
HAD
TEA
WITH
HER
OTHER
SISTER
-
AND
THEN
WENT
TO
CATCH
THE
742
-
HER
SISTER
SAW
HER
TO
THE
STATION
-
HELPING
HER
WITH
SOME
OF
HER
PACKAGES
-
THIS
SISTER
WAS
ABLE
TO
ESTABLISH
THAT
SHE
HAD
CARRIED
A
GREEN
PURSE
AND
HAD
BOUGHT
A
RAILWAY
TICKET
-
BUT
BOTH
PURSE
AND
TICKET
-
AND
THE
PACKAGES
-
WERE
GONE
WHEN
THE
BODY
WAS
FOUND
AT
WATERLOO
-
NEITHER
THE
SISTERS
NOR
MR
BERRY
THOUGHT
IT
LIKELY
THAT
SHE
HAD
BEEN
CARRYING
MUCH
MONEY
-
A
PORTER
AT
HOUNSLOW
SUPPORTED
THE
SISTERS
STATEMENT
THAT
ELIZABETH
CAMP
HAD
BEEN
ALONE
IN
HER
COMPARTMENT
WHEN
THE
TRAIN
LEFT
-
BUT
THIS
DID
NOT
HELP
MUCH
-
SINCE
IT
HAD
MADE
STOPS
AT
NINE
STATIONS
BEFORE
WATERLOO
-
THE
POLICE
BEGAN
A
SYSTEMATIC
SEARCH
OF
THE
LINE
-
NO
EASY
TASK
-
BUT
ONE
IN
WHICH
PATIENCE
AND
METHOD
PUTNEY
AND
WANDSWORTH
THEY
FOUND
A
BLOODSTAINED
PESTLE
SUCH
AS
CHEMISTS
USE
-
WITH
SOME
HAIRS
STICKING
TO
IT
-
THE
MURDER
WEAPON
-
MORE
THAN
LIKELY
-
AND
PERHAPS
EVIDENCE
ENOUGH
TO
HAVE
BROUGHT
A
BUT
IN
1897
-
ALAS
-
THERE
WAS
NO
FINGERPRINT
BUREAU

NO
EXPERTS
TO

TACKLE

AND
SUPERINTENDENT

MARSHALL
-
OF
SCOTLAND
ACCEPTING
THE
LIKELIHOOD
THAT
MISS
CAMP
HAD
BEEN
ATTACKED
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
ROBBERY
-
THEY
DID
NOT
OVERLOOK
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THIS
MIGHT
HAVE
DISGUISED
ANOTHER
MOTIVE
-
AND
A
THOROUGH
CHECK
ME
WELL
MEANT
-
SOME
MISCHIEVOUS
-
INCLUDING
ONE
THAT
A
MAN
HAD
BEEN
SEEN
FLEEING
FROM
VAUXHALL
STATION
ON
THE
THURSDAY
EVENING
-
WITH
BLOOD
ACTUALLY
DRIPPING
FROM
BEYOND
THE
JURY
HEARING
A
FORMAL
IDENTIFICATION
OF
THE
VICTIM
AND
INSPECTING
AT
WATERLOO
THE
CARRIAGE
IN
WHICH
SHE
HAD
DIED
-
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
ON
ADJOURNED
-
DAY
BY
DAY
THE
POLICE
FOLLOWED
UP
LIKELY
AND
EVEN
UNLIKELY
TRAILS
-
IT
WAS
LEARNED
THAT
ELIZABETH
CAMP
HAD
BEEN
LENDING
MONEY
TO
HER
RELATIVES
-
AND
HER
BROTHERINLAW
WAS
ASKED
FOR
WOMAN
HAD
BEEN
ENGAGED
ONCE
BEFORE
-
TO
A
BARMAN
NAMED
BROWN
-
THIS
MAN
AGREED
THAT
HIS
ENGAGEMENT
HAD
TIFF
-
BUT
DENIED
THAT
HE
OWED
MISS
CAMP
ANY
MONEY
-
ALL
THE
WHILE
THE
POLICE
WERE
CASTING
ABOUT
FOR
A
MAN
WHO
HAD
BEEN
SEEN
LEAVING
THE
TRAIN
AT
WANDSWORTH
-
A
PASSENGER
DESCRIBED
THIS
INDIVIDUAL
A
DARK
MOUSTACHE
-
AND
WEARING
A
FROCKCOAT
AND
A
TOPHAT
-
THE
PORTER
AT
THE
STATION
BORE
OUT
THIS
PERHAPS
THE
NEWS
OF
THEIR
SEARCH
GOT
AROUND
-
FOR
A
MAN
DID
OBLIGINGLY
PRESENT
HIMSELF
COMMITTED
THE
MURDER
-
BUT
HE
WAS
MENTALLY
HAD
BEEN
NOWHERE
NEAR
THE
742
THAT
EVENING
-
EVEN
THE
BONE
CUFFLINKS
FOUND
BESIDE
THE
BODY
-
WHICH
HAD
AT
FIRST
BEEN
CONSIDERED
AS
BELONGING
TO
THE
KILLER
-
PROVED
YET
ANOTHER
RED
HERRING
-
FOR
IT
WAS
LEARNED
THAT
THEY
HAD
BEEN
BORROWED
BY
ELIZABETH
CAMP
FROM
ONE
OF
HER
SISTERS
-
A
YOUNG
MAN
FROM
READING
NAMED
MARSHALL
THIS
MAN
WAS
KNOWN
TO
HAVE
LEFT
HIS
HOME
ON
FEBRUARY
11
-
AND
TO
HAVE
BEEN
AWAY
FOR
FOUR
DAYS
-
NOT
IN
ITSELF
A
CRIME
-
BUT
-
ADDED
TO
THE
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
HE
HAD
GONE
SHOPPING
IN
THE
TOWN
OF
GUIL
DFORD
FOR
A
FALSE
MOUSTACHE
-
IT
LEFT
HIM
WITH
SOMETHING
TO
JOIN
THE
ARMY
-
PRESUMABLY
FEELING
THAT
A
MOUSTACHE
MIGHT
ENHANCE
HIS
MILITARY
BEARING
-
-
AND
THIS
WAS
ACCEPTED
-
AND
SO
THE
INQUEST
-
WHICH
HAD
DRAGGED
ON
-
WITH
ADJOURNMENTS
-
UNTIL
APRIL
7
-
FINALLY
HAD
TO
BE
CONTENT
TO
RETURN
A
VERDICT
OF
-
WILFUL
MURDER
AGAINST
SOME
PERSON
OR
PERSONS
UNKNOWN
-
-
THE
MOST
VITAL
CLUE
OF
THE
WEDGWOOD
HAVE
BEEN
VERY
THANKFUL
THAT
THE
SCIENCE
OF
DACTYLOSCOPY
WAS
ONLY
IN
ITS
BEGINNINGS
-
THE
NEXT
FEMALE
FATALITY
OCCURRED
EIGHT
YEARS
LATER
-
YET
SO
STRANGE
WERE
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT
IT
WAS
A
FURTHER
SEVEN
YEARS
BEFORE
EVEN
A
GHOST
OF
A
SOLUTION
EMERGED
-
THERE
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
SOMETHING
SINISTER
IN
THE
IDEA
OF
TUNNELS
-
THE
BUILDING
OF
THEM
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
DANGEROUS
JOBS
CON
NECTED
WITH
RAILWAY
CONSTRUCTION
-
AND
THERE
WERE
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
BELIEVED
THAT
TO
TRAVEL
THROUGH
TUNNELS
WOULD
BE
AN
EQUALLY
HAZARDOUS
BUSINESS
-
SOME
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
RESULT
WOULD
BE
ALL
SORTS
OF
HORRIBLE
ILLNESSES
BROUGHT
ON
BY
THE
CONFINED
ATMOSPHERE

THE

HAVE
BEEN
ONLY
TWO
OCCASIONS
ON
WHICH
A
BODY
HAS
BEEN
FOUND
IN
A
TUNNEL
OCCURRED
ON
THE
SAME
LINE
-
ALTHOUGH
THIS
TIME
THE
VICTIM
WAS
A
WOMAN
-
THOUGH
IN
THE
MINDS
OF
MOST
PEOPLE
THERE
WAS
NO
DOUBT
THAT
THE
WOMAN
HAD
BEEN
THE
VICTIM
WAS
NOT
SUFFICIENT
EVIDENCE
TO
SHOW
WHETHER
AND
SOME
TIME
BEFORE
MIDNIGHT
ON
SEPTEMBER
24
-
1905
-
A
SUNDAY
-
SUBINSPECTOR
PEACOCK
-
OF
IT
WAS
THE
BATTERED
AND
BROKEN
BODY
OF
A
WOMAN
-
HE
SENT
WORD
STRAIGHT
AWAY
TO
NEARBY
MERSTHAM
STATION
-
AND
A
STRETCHER
PARTY
TOOK
THE
BODY
TO
THE
FEATHERS
HOTEL
TO
AWAIT
IDENTIFICATION
-
WAS
IT
A
CASE
OF
SUICIDE
-
WHERE
SOME
UNHAPPY
SOUL
HAD
WALKED
DELIBERATELY
INTO
THE
BLACKNESS
AND
INTO
THE
PATH
OF
SOME
TRAIN
-
THIS
HARDLY
SEEMED
WAS
FOUND
TO
HAVE
HER
OWN
SILK
SCARF
DRAWN
ALMOST
TIGHT
ENOUGH
TO
STRANGLE
HER
-
AND
THE
ENDS
BOTH
HER
WRISTS
BORE
THE
MARKS
OF
SEVERE
BRUISING
-
AND
THERE
WERE
OTHER
INJURIES
ON
HER
BODY
WHICH
HAD
OCCURRED
BEFORE
HER
DEATH
WAS
ENSURED
BY
SOME
TRAIN
WHICH
HAD
ROARED
THROUGH
THE
TUNNEL
-
THERE
WERE
NO
LETTERS
OR
PAPERS
FOUND
ON
HER
TO
ASSIST
IDENTI
FICATION
-
NO
MONEY
-
AND
NO
RAILWAY
TICKET
-
BY
THEN
REPORTS
WERE
BEING
GATHERED
ABOUT
ALL
TRAFFIC
OVER
THIS
STRETCH
OF
LINE
-
BUT
NO
INFORMATION
WAS
FORTHCOMING
ABOUT
ANY
CARRIAGE
WITH
AN
OPEN
DOOR
-
NOR
ANY
PASSENGER
REPORTING
AN
INCIDENT
WHICH
MIGHT
RELATE
-
LONG
BROWN
HAIR
IN
A
BUN
AT
THE
BACK
OF
HER
HEAD
REMAINED
A
MYSTERY
UNTIL
LATER
THE
FOLLOWING
DAY
-
DURING
THAT
TIME
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
GIRL
WAS
CIRCULATED
-
AND
A
MR
ROBERT
MONEY
CAME
FORWARD
TO
IDENTIFY
HER
AS
HIS
SISTER
-
MARY
MONEY
-
AGED
TWENTYTWO
-
ON
THE
SUNDAY
-
THE
DAY
OF
HER
DEATH
-
SHE
HAD
GONE
OUT
IN
THE
EVENING
AT
ABOUT
SEVEN
OCLOCK
-
TELLING
HER
ROOMMATE
-
EMMA
HONE
-
THAT
SHE
WAS
GOING
FOR
A
WALK
-
BUT
WOULD
NOT
BE
GONE
FOR
LONG
-
ACCORDING
TO
MISS
HONE
-
SHE
HAD
NOT
BEEN
CARRYING
A
HANDBAG
-
BUT
SHE
BELIEVED
SHE
HAD
HAD
A
SMALL
PURSE
-
AT
CLAPHAM
JUNCTION
A
TICKETCOLLECTOR
WAS
ABLE
TO
IDENTIFY
A
PHOTOGRAPH
OF
THE
GIRL
-
AND
HE
SAID
HE
HAD
LAST
SEEN
HER
A
TRAIN
FOR
THE
SHORT
RUN
TO
VICTORIA
-
A
PASSENGER
AT
VICTORIA
SAID
HE
HAD
SEEN
A
YOUNG
LADY
-
AS
NEAR
AS
POSSIBLE
-
LIKE
THE
PHOTOGRAPH
SHOWN
HIM
-
WITH
A
MAN
-
VERY
CLOSE
IN
CONVERSATION
AND
WALKING
ARM
IN
ARM
-
-
A
GUARD
REPORTED
THAT
AT
EAST
CROYDON
HE
HAD
SEEN
WHAT
WAS
ACCEPTED
AS
THE
SAME
COUPLE
SITTING
CLOSE
TOGETHER
IN
A
FIRSTCLASS
COMPARTMENT
OF
THE
TRAIN
FROM
LONDON
BRIDGE
OF
WHICH
HE
WAS
IN
CHARGE
-
THE
TWO
COULD
HAVE
JOINED
THIS
TRAIN
BY
TAKING
ONE
FROM
VICTORIA
AND
CHANGING
AT
EAST
CROYDON
-
HE
ALSO
BELIEVED
THAT
THEY
HAD
STILL
BEEN
TOGETHER
AT
SOUTH
CROYDON
-
AND
HE
REMEMBERED
MEDICAL
EVIDENCE
ESTABLISHED
THAT
MARY
MONEY
HAD
BEEN
DEAD
FOR
ABOUT
AN
HOUR
BEFORE
HER
BODY
WAS
DISCOVERED
-
AND
THIS
MATCHED
REASONABLY
WELL
WITH
THE
TIMETABLE
OF
THE
TRAIN
IN
QUESTION
-
MORE
IMPORTANT
EVIDENCE
CAME
FROM
A
SIGNALMAN
AT
PURLEY
OAKS
-
WHO
HAD
SEEN
-
AS
THE
TRAIN
PASSED
HIS
BOX
-
A
COUPLE
STRUGGLING
IN
A
FIRSTCLASS
COMPARTMENT
-
BUT
HE
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
USED
TO
SEEING
COUPLES
ENGAGED
IN
SOME
YEARS
AGO
A
CONTEMPORARY
PHILOSOPHER
TOLD
US
THAT
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
AN
EN

WOULD
NOT
SAY

NOTHING
AN
ITALIAN
WOULD
NOT
SING
-
NO

TOLD

AN

NOTHING
THE

AND
NOTHING
THE

WOULD
NOT

-
IT
IS
NOT
OUR
PURPOSE
TO
DISCUSS
THIS
DICTUM
-
SUFFICE
TO
SAY
THAT
FEW
OF
US
STOP
TO
MARVEL
AT
THE
PROGRESS
OF
CIVILISATION
WHICH
ALLOWS
A
DISH
BORROWED
STRAIGHT
FROM
THE
PREHISTORIC
-
HOW
MANY
CENTURIES
AGO
-
IN
SOME
CAVE
OR
HILLY
HIDE
-
DID
OUR
FOREBEARS
HOME
FROM
THE
CHASE
HOLD
FORTH
FROM
A
SPEAR
THE
WELCOME
GOBBET
OF
MEAT
OR
FISH
BURNT
AND
ROASTED
IN
THE
HOMELY

HOW
MANY
CENTURIES

DID
THE
MERCENARY
IN

THUS
IMPALE
ON
PIKE
OR
LANCE
HIS
EVENING

CAME
THE
THRIFTY

TOYING
WITH
THESE
PRIMITIVE

IN
THE

OF
OUR
LATTERDAY
RESTAURANTS

AND
-
IF
CERTAIN
DISHES

MODES
OF
FOOD
HAVE
PERSISTED
DOWN
THE

THE
MOTIVE
THAT
PRESERVED
ALWAYS
BEEN
STRONG
IN
MANKIND
-
THE
SHARING
OF
A
MEAL
IN
THOSE
EARLIEST
DANGEROUS
DAYS
WAS
AN
ADMITTANCE
INTO
AN
ACQUAINTANCESHIP
FAR
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
THE
CASUAL

OF
THE
PRESENT
DAY
-
THE
DESIRE
TO
SHARE
SOMETHING
MORE
INTIMATE
THAN
MERE
CONVERSE
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
THERE
-
THE
TRUTH
IS
THAT
GOOD
FOOD
OFFERS
A
PROGRAMME
OF
ENTERTAINMENT
ALMOST
UNLIMITED
IN
ITS
VARIETY
AND
ITS
PRESEN
TATION
AFFORDS
AN
OPPORTUNITY
OF
SHOWING
A
GUEST
SOMETHING
OF
OURSELVES
-
MEALTIMES
OF
A
SIMPLER
WORLD
TO
THE
BANQUETS
OF
LATER
DAYS
-
WHEN
THE
TABLE
GROANED
UNDER
ITS
LOAD
OF
COMPLICATED

AROUND

THE

THERE
WAS
ALWAYS
THE

AT

-
THEN
THE
PRIMARY
ESSENTIAL
TO

OF
A

WHICH

CALAIS
-
CHERBOURG

AND
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO

OF

WITHOUT
A
LARGESCALE
AND
CONCENTRATED
INVASION
-
BUT
NONE
OF
THESE
DEDUCTIONS
WERE
DRAWN
AT

BECAUSE

REQUIRED
MONEY

AND
THE
CITIZENS
WHO
HAD
THE
MONEY
WERE
NOT

SUFFICIENTLY
AT

WITH

AND
KING
TO
THINK
THEIR

WELL
SPENT
IN
FIN
ANCING
A
RULING
CLASS
WHICH
DESPISED
THEM
-
THE

WERE
GLAD
ENOUGH
TO
ENJOY
THE
FRUITS
IN
THIS
CRUEL
PROCESS
WHICH
WAS
HAMMERING
OUT
NATIONS
ON
THE
ANVILS
OF
WAR
-
THERE
WAS
A
CONSTANT
STIRRING
OF
THOSE
IN

TO
FIND
SOME
SIMPLE
WAY
OUT
OF
THE
COMPLICATED
FINANCIAL
6IMPASSE
WHICH
ALWAYS

AND

BE
SET

NOT

FOR
A
VERY
WIDE
RANGE
OF

WAS
THE
UNCERTAIN
BOUNTY

WAS
THEREFORE
ALWAYS

WITH
THE
VAIN

SU

AND

-
TOGETHER
WITH
A
THERE
WERE
TWO
OTHER
SOURCES
OF

REVENUE
-
FIRST
-
THE
CHURCH
-
WHICH
WISELY
FOLLOWED
THE
LEAD
OF
THE

AND
IN
ITS
OWN
CONVOCATIONS
THE
FOREIGN
MERCHANTS
-
WITH
WHOM
THE
KINGS
OFFICIALS
HAD
FORMERLY
MADE
PRIVATE
BARGAINS

WERE

AUTHORIZED
BY

SANCTION
AT

ROUGHLY
FIFTY
PER

IN
EXCESS
OF
THE

FOR

-
IN
ADDITION
TO
THESE
REVENUES
-
THE
KING
HAD
THE
FINANCIAL
BENEFITS
OF
HIS
POSITION
AT
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
FEUDAL
SYSTEM
-
AS
ITS
CHIEF
LANDOWNER
AND
THE
RECIPIENT
OF
THE
FINES
OF
ROYAL
JUSTICE
-
IT
WAS
-
THEREFORE
-
A
COMPLICATED
AND
NOT
VERY
SATISFACTORY
FINANCIAL
SYSTEM
IN
WHICH
THE
BORDERS
BETWEEN
PRIVATE
AND
PUBLIC
PURSE
WERE
AND
NATIONAL
WAR
-
AND
IN
WHICH
THE
COMPARATI
VELY
SIMPLE

OF

PYRAMID
BUT
THIS
TIME
THERE
WAS
A
VERY
INTERESTING
ATTEMPT
TO
APPLY
A
SLIDING
SCALE
TO
THE

DEMANDED
-
THE
DEFINITION
OF
AN

WAS
ALTERED
TO
READ
-
OVER
SIXTEEN
-
-
AND
-
WHERE
THE
POOREST
WERE
TO

A
GROAT
-
THE
DUKE
OF
LANCASTER
AND
THE
ARCHBISHOPS
OF
CANTERBURY
AND

WERE
TO
PAY
TEN
MARKS
-
AND
BETWEEN
THESE
TWO
EXTREMES
A
GRADUATED
SCALE
OF
PAYMENTS
WAS
FIXED
FOR
THE
DIFFERENT
CLASSES
OF
LAYMEN
AND
CLERICS
-
AGAIN
THE

WAS
WIDESPREAD

THE

DISAPPOINTING

A

ESTIMATED

50000
IN

RAISED
ONLY
27000

IN
THE
FOLLOWING
YEAR

-
THE
LAST
AND
MOST
NOTORIOUS
THIRD
POLLTAX
WAS
AGREED
BY
A
PARLIAMENT
WHICH
MET
AT
NORTHAMPTON
-
THERE
WERE
DARK
REASONS
FOR
A
MEETING
SO
FAR
AWAY
FROM
THE
CAPITAL
IN
A
TOWN
WITH
POOR
COMMUNICATIONS
AND
NOT
OVER
SUPPLIED
WITH
HOSTELRIES
AND
LODGINGS
-
LONDON
WAS
AGAIN
IN

BUT
THIS
TIME
OVER
A
QUESTION
OF

RIVALRY

A
RICH
MER
CHANT
FROM

HAD
BEEN
MURDERED
-
AND
JOHN
DE
KYRKBY
-
A
LONDONER
-
WAS
ONE
OF
THOSE
CHARGED
WITH
THE
CRIME
-
IT
IS
CLEAR
FROM
THE
CHRONICLES
THAT
THIS
WAS
A
SORDID
QUARREL
BETWEEN
MONOPOLISTS
AND
INTERLOPERS
-
THE
CITY
MERCHANTS
WERE
JEALOUS
OF
FOREIGN
MERCHANTS
WHO
COULD
TEMPT
COURT
AND
BARONAGE
WITH
RARER
LUXURIES
THAN
THOSE
A
SUM
OF
160000
WAS
DEMANDED
-
A
STAGGERING
FIGURE
TO
MEDIAEVAL
EYES
-
IT
WAS
DETERMINED
THAT
100000
WAS
A
FAIRER
TARGET
-
AND
THE
PARLIAMENT
AGREED
TO
FIND
TWOTHIRDS
OF
THIS
SUM
PROVIDING
THE
CLERGY
SUPPLIED
THE
REMAINDER
-
THE
METHOD
OF
ASSESSMENT
TO
WHICH
THE

AGREED
WAS
THAT
OF
THE
FIRST

-
THE
MANIFEST
INJUSTICE
OF
THIS
METHOD
HAD
BEEN
TO
A
CERTAIN
DEGREE
CORRECTED
BY
THE
SLIDING
SCALE
OF
THE
SECOND
POLLTAX
-
BUT
THIS
LESSON
WAS
IGNORED
-
AND
THE
INJUSTICE
TREBLED
IN
WEIGHT
BY
A
FLATRATE
TAX
AT
TREBLE
THE

-
EVERY

WAS
ARRIVED
AT
BY
A
SIMPLE
THE
ONLY
CONCESSION
MADE
IN
VIEW
OF
THE
OBJECTIONS
TO
THE
FIRST
TWO
POLLTAXES
WAS
THE
SUGGESTION
THAT
THE
RICH
SHOULD
HELP
THE
POOR
-
BUT
THIS
WAS
ONLY
A
PIOUS
HOPE
BECAUSE
NO
MACHINERY
WAS
PROVIDED
FOR
CARRYING
IT
INTO

-
AND
A
SUBORDINATE
IN
CHAPTER
TWO
HE
GAUGED
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
HEARTS

FROM
THE
DISSECTION
OF

SHOWING
HOW
THESE
MOVE
MENTS
ALTERNATE
WITH

AND
ARE
SEEN
BEST
IN
COLD
ANIMALS
OR
IN
FLAGGING
WARMER
ONES
-
AT
THE
TIME
OF
ITS
MOVEMENT
THE
HEART
BECOMES
GENERALLY
CONSTRICTED
-
ITS
WALLS
THICKEN
-
ITS
VENTRICLES
DECREASE
IN

AND
IT
EXPELS
ITS
CONTENT
OF

-
APPEARING
PALER
IN
SO
DOING
IN
ANIMALS
SUCH
AS
SERPENTS
-
FROGS
-
AND
THE
LIKE
-
AT
ONE
AND
THE
SAME
TIME
-
THEREFORE
-
OCCUR
THE
BEAT
OF
THE
APEX
-
THE
THICKENING
OF
THE
HEART
WALLS
-
AND
THE
FORCIBLE
EXPULSION
OF
THEIR
CONTAINED
BLOOD
BY
THE
CONTRACTION
OF
THE
VENTRICLES
-
GOING
ON
IN
CHAPTER
THREE
TO
THE
MOVEMENT
OF
THE
ARTERIES

LIKEWISE
GAUGED
FROM
THE
DISSECTIONS
OF
LIVING
ANIMALS
-
HARVEY
NOTED
THAT
CONTRACTION
OF

AND
THE

OCCUR
IN
SYSTOLE

SIMULTANEOUSLY
WITH
DILATATION
OF
THE
ARTERIES
AND
OF
THE
ARTERYLIKE
VEIN

AND
EXPULSION

THERE

ARTERIAL
DIASTOLE

THUS
SYNCHRONOUS
WITH

SYSTOLE
BUT

WHEN

IS
HINDERED
BY

GEORGE
WON
MANY

WHEN

WERE

1000000

WERE

DISCIPLINED

WHEN
ONLY
20
PER

OF

STOOD
TO
GAIN
ANYTHING
FROM
THE
STRIKE
AND
THE
OTHER
80
PER

MADE
SACRIFICES
FOR
THEIR
FELLOW
MEN
-
THIS
REMARKABLE
STRIKE
RAISED
THE
QUESTION
OF
A
LIVING
WAGE
AND
SHOWED
THE
WORTH
OF
THE
SOON
THEY
WERE
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
SING
AT
MEETINGS
-
ONE
OF
THE
HELPFUL
BYPRODUCTS
WAS
THAT
THEY
WERE
ABLE
TO
OBTAIN
SOME

ONE
OF
THE
STUDENTS
WAS
YOUNG
GEORGE

OFTEN
SPOKE
AT

HE
CHRISTENED
THE
BABIES
-
ALSO
-
WHEN
AT
FUNERALS
-
RELIGION
WAS
ONE
OF
HIS
PET
SUBJECTS
-
FOR
BEING
WELL
ACQUAINTED
WITH
THE
BIBLE
-
WHICH
HE
HAD
ALTHOUGH
HIS
IDEAS
WERE
DIAMETRICALLY
OPPOSED
TO
THOSE
OF
PARSONS
HE
GOT
ON
WONDERFULLY
WELL
WITH
THEM
-
PARTICULARLY
THOSE
WHO
-
LIKE
THE
REV
THE
CHURCH
SOCIALIST
LEAGUE
-
GENUINELY
ADVOCATED
SOCIALISM
-
WITH
SUCH
MEN
-
WHO
HAD
THE
COURAGE
OF
THEIR
CONVICTIONS
AND
THEIR
CHRISTIANITY
-
COMMON
GROUND
COULD
BE
FOUND

THERE
WAS
NO
ABATEMENT
IN
POLITICAL
WORK
-
THE
BRITISH
SOCIALIST
PARTY
ENDEA
COUNCIL
-
AND
TO
PARLIAMENT
-
BEING
DETER
MINED
AND
OBDURATE
IN
THEIR
ATTITUDE
THAT
THEIR
CANDIDATE
MUST
GO
FORWARD
IN
THE
ELECTIONS
-
IN
THE
SHEFFIELD
TRADES
AND
LABOUR
COUNCIL
MEETING
ON
OCTOBER
16
-
1912
-
GEORGE
HAD
SAID
-
-
MR
BARTON
WOULD
GO
TO
THE
POLL
-
JUST
AS
THE
LABOUR
PARTY
HAD
FOUGHT
THE
LIBERALS
-
THEY
WERE
GOING
TO
FIGHT
THE
LABOUR
THIS
NEW
PARTY
-
THE
BRITISH
SOCIALIST
PARTY
-
WAS
NOT
PREPARED
TO
ACCEPT
THE
ROLE
OF
JUNIOR
HELPER
PROPAGANDA
IN
ORDER
TO
INCREASE
THE
VOLUME
OF
SOCIALIST
THOUGHT
IN
THE
CITY
-
BUT
SOUGHT
TO
CREATE
IN
THE
LABOUR
MOVEMENT
A
MORE
MILITANT
ATTITUDE
CAPABLE
OF
ACHIEVING
SOCIALISM
FOR
THE
WORKING
PEOPLE
-
ALF
BARTON
-
WHO
IN
1911
WAS
PRESENTED
WITH
A
BOOK
ON
THE
LIFE
OF
MARX
-
AND
A
GOLD
PURSE
IN
RECOGNITION
OF
HIS
WORK
FOR
THE
MOVEMENT
-
WAS
LATER
CESSARY
TO
UNDERSTAND
MARXISM
IN
ORDER
TO
HE
WAS
A
KEEN
MEMBER
OF
THE
BSP
A
WALK
OVER
THE
FIELDS
WHILE
WE
ATTENDED
TO
OUR
BUSINESS
-
TO
MY
AMUSEMENT
-
WHEN
WE
MET
AT
TEA
AT
THE
RECTORY
AFTER
THE
DEDICATION
-
THE
ARCHBISHOP
SAID
HE
HAD
BEEN
STOPPED
BY
A
FARMER
IN
A
FIELD
-
HE
SEEMED
RATHER
INDIGNANT
-
BUT
WE
TOOK
THE
EPISODE
WITHOUT
A
SMILE
TILL
AFTERWARDS
-
THE
HALL
PROVED
MOST
USEFUL
-
ESPECIALLY
IN
WINTER
WHEN
THE
DISTANCE
TO
THE
CHURCH
DETERRED
MANY
FROM
COMING
TO
SUNDAY
EVENSONG
-
WE
MANAGED
TO
FURNISH
A
TABLE
WITH
CROSS
AND
CANDLES
-
AND
THE
PEOPLE
APPRECIATED
THE
CHURCH
HALL
FOR
WORSHIP
AS
WELL
AS
FOR
MORE
SECULAR
PURPOSES
-
IN
1910
DR
TALBOT
WAS
TRANSLATED
TO
WINCHESTER
-
AND
DR
HUBERT
BURGE
BECAME
BISHOP
OF
SOUTHWARK
-
MEANWHILE
I
HAD
BEEN
ASKED
TO
DO
A
BIT
OF
DIOCESAN
WORK
IN
CONNECTION
WITH
HIGHER
RELIGIOUS
EDUCATION
-
AND
TO
BECOME
THE
SOUTHWARK
SECRETARY
OF
THE
CHURCH
READING
UNION
-
THIS
MEANT
ORGANIZING
LECTURES
AND
COURSES
OF
RELIGIOUS
INSTRUCTION
THROUGH
THE
DIOCESE
-
AND
I
ALSO
FOUND
MYSELF
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
DIOCESAN
CONFERENCE
-
WHERE
I
REMEMBER
INTRODUCING
MYSELF
AS
THE
INCUMBENT
OF
THE
HIGHEST
CHURCH
IN
THE
DIOCESE
-
THERE
WAS
A
SOMEWHAT
SHOCKED
ATMOSPHERE
IN
SOME
QUARTERS
-
UNTIL
I
EXPLAINED
THAT
MY
CHURCH
WAS
800
FEET
HIGH
ABOVE
THE
SEA
LEVEL
-
THE
WORK
WAS
GROWING
PRETTY
HEAVY
-
AND
WE
MANAGED
TO
GET
A
STIPENDIARY
LAYMAN
WHO
COULD
HELP
AMONG
THE
CHILDREN
AND
YOUNG
PEOPLE
-
IT
WAS
WHILE
I
WAS
AT
TATSFIELD
THAT
I
FIRST
VISITED
OBERAMMERGAU
IN
BAVARIA
TO
WITNESS
THE
PASSION
PLAY
-
THE
PLACE
AND
ITS
PEOPLE
WERE
TO
PLAY
AN
IMPORTANT
PART
IN
MY
LIFE
-
FOR
FIVE
YEARS
IN
SUCCESSION
TILL
WAR
BROKE
OUT
IN
1914
-
I
SPENT
MY
SUMMER
HOLIDAYS
THERE
AND
BECAME
VERY
INTIMATE
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
AND
THE
ENVIRONS
-
EVERY
YEAR
BETWEEN
THE
PASSION
PLAYS
-
AN
INTERVAL
OF
TEN
YEARS
-
ANOTHER
PLAY
WOULD
BE
PERFORMED
AT
THE
SMALL
THEATRE
IN
THE
VILLAGE
-
WHEN
NEW
TALENT
WOULD
BE
DISCOVERED
AND
TRAINED
-
AFTER
THE
FIRST
WORLD
WAR
-
1914
-
I
DID
NOT
VISIT
GERMANY
FOR
TEN
YEARS
-
BY
WHICH
TIME
IN
1924
I
WAS
IN
A
DIFFERENT
PARISH
IN
SURREY
-
TOWARDS
THE
END
OF
MY
FIVE
AND
A
HALF
YEARS
INCUMBENCY
I
WAS
ASKED
IF
I
WOULD
START
A
VILLAGE
CHORAL
SOCIETY
AND
CONDUCT
IT
-
THIS
OPENED
UP
A
NEW
INTEREST
-
AND
WE
PLUNGED
INTO
IT
-
FIRST
OF
ALL
SIMPLE
PARTSONGS
-
I
FOUND
ONLY
ONE
MEMBER
WHO
HAD
ANY
IDEA
OF
READING
MUSIC
-
THIS
WAS
THE
VILLAGE
DOCTOR
WHO
WAS
AN
OLD
SCHOOL
FRIEND
AT
CLIFTON
-
HE
COULD
SUSTAIN
THE
TENOR
PART
QUITE
WELL
AND
LEAD
THE
OTHERS
-
AS
FOR
BASSES
AND
ALTOS
THE
CONDUCTOR
HAD
TO
TEACH
BY
SINGING
THE
PARTS
WITH
THEM
-
IT
WAS
VERY
AMUSING
-
AND
BY
THE
END
OF
A
FEW
MONTHS
AN
ENTHUSIASTIC
CHOIR
OF
MEN
AND
WOMEN
COULD
RENDER
SIMPLE
PARTSINGING
TOLERABLY
WELL
-
THEN
WE
WENT
TO
WORK
ON
COLERIDGE
TAYLORS
-
HIAWATHAS
WEDDING
FEAST
-
-
ENTHUSIASM
GREW
-
AND
IN
A
FEW
MORE
MONTHS
WE
GAVE
A
CONCERT
AT
WHICH
THE
ACCOMPANIST
WAS
THE
VILLAGE
SCHOOLMASTER
-
AND
THE
TENOR
SOLO
-
ONAWAY
AWAKE
-
WAS
SUNG
BY
THE
RECTOR
-
AND
WE
WERE
ALL
HAPPY
-
IN
1913
DR
BURGE
-
BISHOP
OF
SOUTHWARK
-
ASKED
ME
TO
GO
AS
WHO
WAS
TO
BECOME
A
VERY
INTIMATE
FRIEND
-
AND
I
WAS
SOLICITOR
COUSIN
-
AS
BISHOP
TALBOT
HAD
TOLD
ME
THAT
I
OUGHT
NOT
TO
SPEND
MANY
YEARS
IN
TATSFIELD
-
WE
HELD
GREAT
FAMILY
CONSULTATIONS
-
MY
ELDEST
BROTHER
WAS
THEN
LIVING
IN
LIMPSFIELD
WITH
HIS
FAMILY
-
AND
FOUND
A
VERY
SUITABLE
HOUSE
NEARBY
WHERE
MY
MOTHER
SETTLED
-
AND
EVENTUALLY
DIED
IN
1926
AT
THE
INSTITUTION
AND
INDUCTION
SERVICE
IN
ST
MARKS
-
THIS
WAS
TAKEN
BY
THE
SUFFRAGAN
BISHOP
OF
WOOLWICH
-
A
CLOSE
FRIEND
OF
OURS
-
BUT
WHAT
A
CHANGE
FROM
THE
DEAR
LITTLE
OLD
CHURCH
AT
TATSFIELD
TO
THE
GREAT
MODERN
CHURCH
OF
ST
MARKS
AT
PURLEY
-
ONE
FELT
AT
TATSFIELD
THAT
-
SMALL
AS
THE
HAD
BEEN
A
HOUSE
OF
PRAYER
-
I
COULD
NOT
BUT
FEEL
THE
CHILLINESS
OF
THE
NEW
CHURCH
-
BEAUTIFUL
AS
IT
WAS
AND
IS
-
WHEN
WE
HAD
FOUND
A
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
GLADLY
COOPERATED
-
WE
MADE
THE
LITTLE
SIDE
CHAPEL
A
PLACE
OF
DAILY
PRAYER
-
I
SUGGESTED
TO
THE
CONGREGATION
THAT
IT
NEEDED
WARMING
UP
BY
CONSTANT
PRAYER
AND
WORSHIP
-
AND
WE
FOUND
MANY
TO
HELP
-
GIFTS
OF
CANDLESTICKS
AND
STAINEDGLASS
LANCET
WINDOWS
-
FINALLY
A
NEW
ALTAR
-
HELPED
TO
FURNISH
THE
CHAPEL
AS
A
LITTLE
SANCTUARY
FOR
PRAYER
AND
QUIET
-
IN
TIME
WE
RECEIVED
SIMILAR
WINDOWS
-
IT
WAS
VERY
INTERESTING
TO
HAVE
THE
PRIVILEGE
OF
FILLING
SUCH
A
BEAUTIFUL
BUILDING
WITH
SUITABLE
FITTINGS
-
I
MADE
THE
ARCHITECT
-
HIMSELF
A
FINE
ARTIST
-
IT
IS
QUITE
POSSIBLE
TO
PUT
BEAUTIFUL
THINGS
INTO
A
BEAUTIFUL
CHURCH
AND
YET
SPOIL
THE
BUILDING
WITH
ORNAMENTS
UNSUI
TABLE
TO
THE
ENVIRONS
-
WE
ALSO
HAD
A
LITTLE
MISSION
HALL
LEADING
OFF
THE
BRIGHTON
ROAD
-
IN
A
STREET
FULL
OF
SMALL
HOUSES
-
THIS
WAS
CALLED
ELLEN
AVENUE
WHEN
I
FIRST
WENT
THERE
-
BUT
WAS
SOON
CHANGED
INTO
THE
BETTER
WERE
LOTS
OF
CHILDREN
THERE
-
AND
WE
HAD
A
FLOURISHING
SUNDAY
SCHOOL
AND
AN
EVENING
MORE
HELP
BOTH
AT
THE
CHURCH
AND
MISSION
DISTRICT
-
THE
CHURCH
ARMY
CAPTAIN
HAD
DONE
VERY
GOOD
WORK
IN
THE
LANSDOWNE
ROAD
DISTRICT
-
BUT
I
NEEDED
MORE
HELP
IN
THE
CHURCH
FOR
THE
FULL
ROTA
OF
SERVICES
ON
SUNDAYS
AND
WEEKDAYS
-
1913
SOON
AFTER
I
HAD
COME
-
AND
HE
ORGANIZED
THE
MISSION
DISTRICT
AND
GOT
TO
KNOW
-
AND
BE
KNOWN
BY
-
MANY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
PARISH
-
A
GREAT
BLOW
DISTURBED
ALL
OUR
EFFORTS
IN
THE
FOLLOWING
THE
FORCES
WERE
URGENTLY
NEEDED
-
AND
I
FELT
CLEARLY
THAT
ONE
OF
US
MUST
VOLUNTEER
-
THE
BISHOP
-
DR
BURGE
-
DID
NOT
WISH
ME
TO
GO
THEN
-
AS
I
HAD
BARELY
BEEN
IN
THE
PARISH
WAS
VERY
SOON
IN
FRANCE
WHERE
HE
DID
SPLENDID
WORK
UNTIL
HIS
HEALTH
BROKE
DOWN
AND
HE
HAD
A
BAD
ATTACK
OF
ENTERIC
FEVER
-
MEANWHILE
IN
PURLEY
THERE
WAS
MUCH
ACTIVITY
AND
MUCH
AT
A
LARGE
PUBLIC
MEETING
WE
LAUNCHED
THE
PROJECT
KNOWN
AS
THE
WIVES
AND
RELATIONS
OF
THE
SOLDIERS
TO
GET
THEIR
-
SEPARATION
-
IN
THE
WINTER
OF
1914
AND
1915
THE
MATTER
OF
WAR
PENSIONS
OF
THE
COMMITTEE
IN
COULSDON
AND
PURLEY
-
PURLEY
-
AND
FROM
1922
AT
SURBITON
-
I
WAS
CONTINUOUSLY
TASK
INVOLVED
A
VERY
GREAT
DEAL
OF
DETAILED
WORK
FOR
THE
COMMITTEE
-
WE
HAD
A
SPLENDID
BODY
OF
LOCAL
RESIDENTS
-
COMMITTEE
MET
ONCE
A
WEEK
IN
THE
EVENINGS
-
AND
INCLUDED
PROFESSIONAL
MEN
FROM
EVERY
WALK
OF
LIFE
-
VERY
SOON
WE
MANAGED
TO
GET
A
HUT
IN
PURLEY
WHERE
SOLDIERS
WERE
VERY
WELCOME
AND
THE
LADIES
ORGANIZED
A
CANTEEN
-
LIFE
WAS
IN
THOSE
YEARS
MORE
THAN
BUSY
-
WE
NOW
HAD
A
VICARAGE
NEXT
TO
THE
CHURCH
-
AND
I
WAS
MOST
FORTUNATE
IN
HAVING
FOR
EIGHT
YEARS
A
MOST
ABLE
AND
DEVOTED
HOUSEKEEPER
WHOM
I
HAD
KNOWN
WELL
IN
LIMPSFIELD
WHERE
SHE
HAD
A
HOUSE
NEXT
TO
THE
ON
HEARING
THAT
I
WAS
TO
LEAVE
TATSFIELD
AND
COME
TO
PURLEY
SHE
OFFERED
TO
COME
AND
LOOK
AFTER
ME
-
SHE
WAS
A
REAL
TREASURE
-
OF
YEOMAN
STOCK
AND
CLEVER
IN
ALL
DOMESTIC
THINGS
-
A
WIDOW
WHO
KNEW
HOW
TO
LOOK
AFTER
THE
-
BOY
-
-
WHO
WAS
THE
ONLY
OTHER
OCCUPANT
OF
THE
HOUSE
WHEN
WE
GATHERED
TOGETHER
A
SPLENDID
SUNDAY
BEING
GIVEN
A
NUMBER
WHICH
-
AS
THEY
CAME
INTO
THE
SUPERINTENDENT
WHO
FILLED
IN
THE
REGI
STER
AT
HER
OWN
HOME
-
EACH
CHILD
HAD
A
PICTURE
GIVEN
THEM
AND
THE
LESSON
WAS
LARGELY
BASED
ON
THIS
-
IT
WAS
ON
A
STAMP
WHICH
COULD
BE
STUCK
IN
THEIR
BOOK
-
AND
THERE
WAS
QUITE
A
CLAMOUR
FOR
BACK
STAMPS
IF
A
CHILD
IT
WAS
QUITE
AMUSING
TO
SEE
HOW
MUCH
OF
PARENTS
OR
FAITHFUL
NURSES
THREATEN
ANY
IT
IS
A
GREAT
JOY
TO
MEET
THEM
NOW
FIFTY
YEARS
AFTERWARDS
WHEN
SO
MANY
SPEAKING
OF
CHURCHWARDENS
AND
CHILDREN
LEADS
ME
AT
ONCE
TO
CHRONICLE
A
MOST
INTIMATE
AND
LASTING
FRIENDSHIP
BEGUN
IN
1913
IN
PURLEY
AND
CONTINUING
TILL
OLD
AGE
TODAY
-
WHEN
I
WENT
TO
ST
MARKS
-
THE
FIRST
CONTACT
I
MADE
WAS
SONS
WAS
JUST
COMING
INTO
THE
WORLD
IN
THIS
YEAR
OF
1913
-
FROM
THEN
TILL
NOW
THE
ACQUAINTANCE
RIPENED
INTO
A
VERY
DEEP
FRIENDSHIP
WHICH
I
HAVE
TAKEN
WITH
ME
THROUGH
MRS
CHARLTON
HAVE
BEEN
FROM
THE
FIRST
DIFFICULT
YEARS
OF
WAR
-
WHEN
MOST
LIVES
WERE
UPSET
AND
SOME
TEMPERS
WERE
EASILY
FRAYED
-
THE
MOST
THEIR
HOMES
-
FOR
SINCE
THOSE
YEARS
THEY
HAVE
LIVED
ON
IN
PURLEY
-
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
HAVENS
OF
REST
-
AND
THE
WELCOME
HAS
NEVER
FAILED
-
THEIR
THREE
BOYS
-
NOW
SUCCESSFUL
MEN
-
OUTSET
-
AND
WHEN
WE
DONT
SEE
ONE
ANOTHER
WE
DO
NOT
FORGET
-
IN
THOSE
EARLY
YEARS
191418
-
LIFE
WAS
VERY
FULL
BOTH
IN
THE
PARISH
AND
IN
THE
WIDER
WAR
ACTIVITIES
-
THE
BISHOP
-
KNOWING
THAT
I
SPENT
MY
HOLIDAYS
IN
BAVARIA
-
ASKED
ME
IF
I
WOULD
DO
SOMETHING
FOR
TWO
WARDS
AT
THE
ROYAL
HERBERT
HOSPITAL
-
FULL
OF
WAR
PRISONERS
-
I
WAS
VERY
GLAD
TO
HELP
IN
THIS
WAY
-
AND
VISITED
THEM
FREQUENTLY
-
ESTABLISHING
AT
ONCE
A
FRIENDLY
CONTACT
WITH
THE
BAVARIAN
WOUNDED
WHO
WERE
DELIGHTED
TO
FIND
SOMEONE
WHO
KNEW
THEIR
NATIVE
VILLAGES
-
I
COULD
AT
ONCE
NOTICE
THE
GREAT
ANTAGONISM
BETWEEN
THE
BAVARIANS
AND
THE
PRUSSIANS
WHO
OPENLY
SCORNED
THESE
MORE
SIMPLE
COUNTRY
FOLK
-
LESS
THAN
NO
RESPONSE
FROM
THE
RUSSIAN
SIDE
LED
ONE
TO
FEAR
THAT
THE
EVENT
MIGHT
WELL
HAVE
THE
OUTCOME
THAT
THE
NAZIS
EVIDENTLY
HOPED
MIGHT
THE
SETTING
UP
AMONG
THE
GERMAN
POPULATION
OF
A
GENERAL
SYSTEM
OF
-
FRANCSTIREURS
-
-
TO
BE
NAMED
-
WEREWOLVES
-
-
THE
NAZI
FORTRESS
CONCEPT
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
FANTASY
-
THANKS
TO
THE
GOOD
SENSE
OF
THE
FRONT
LINE
SOLDIERS
-
THE
MEETING
OF
EAST
AND
WEST
WAS
MARKED
BY
THE
USE
OF
NO
WEAPON
MORE
LETHAL
THAN
VODKA
-
AND
THE
EFFECT
ON
THE
GERMAN
PEOPLE
OF
THE
FIRST
TEN
YEARS
OF
THE
PROMISED
THOUSAND
OF
NAZI
RULE
-
SO
FAR
FROM
CREATING
A
SPIRIT
OF
WARLIKE
FRENZY
-
HAD
PRODUCED
UNIVERSALLY
A
DULL
BEWILDERED
APATHY
-
SO
FAR
HAD
OUR
THINKING
LED
US
IN
THIS
MATTER
OF
THE
-
WEREWOLVES
-
THAT
WE
HAD
CONTEMPLATED
THE
NECESSITY
OF
VERY
SPECIAL
PRECAUTIONS
TO
GUARD
THE
LIVES
OF
OUR
AIRMEN
-
PARTICULAR
HATRED
-
WE
FELT
-
WAS
BOUND
TO
BE
AIMED
AT
THE
REPRESENTATIVES
OF
THOSE
WHO
HAD
-
OVER
THE
YEARS
-
SPREAD
SUCH
GHASTLY
HAVOC
-
DESTRUCTION
AND
DEATH
OVER
GERMANY
-
CAUSING
SUCH
WHOLESALE
SLAUGHTER
AMONG
MEN
-
WOMEN
AND
CHILDREN
-
OLD
AND
YOUNG
ALIKE
-
BY
THE
END
OF
THE

STILL
DELIGHTED
IN

HE
TOLD
CLONCURRY
THAT
HE
ENJOYED
IT
AS
MUCH

HIS

HIM

ANY

THE

IS
ARRIVED

WHICH
IS
A
GREAT
RESOURCE

VESUVIUS

TO

HE
IS
GOING
OUT
FAST

-
WHAT
A
GAY

LIVELY
PEOPLE
-
AND
WHAT
A
BUSY
TOWN

AT
ROME
-
EVERY
OTHER

WAS
A
PRIEST

HERE
THE
PRIEST
IS
1SUPERCEDED
BY
THE

A

TROOPS
ARE

DEAR

I
HAVE
RECEIVED
YOUR

OF
YESTERDAY

I
AM
NOT

THE
REMAINDER
OF
MY

SERIOUSLY
ILL

AFTER
MONTHS
OF
SUFFERING

RESORT
IT
WAS
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE

SHOULD
BE
TAKEN
TO
CONSULT
HAHNEMANN
ONCE
AGAIN
-
IT
WAS
NO
LONGER
NECESSARY
TO
GO
FURTHER
THAN
PARIS
-
FOR
BY
THIS
TIME
THE
GREAT
MAN
HAD
BEEN
DRIVEN
FROM
HIS
NATIVE
GERMANY
BY
THE
ANTIPATHY
OF
HIS
ORTHODOX
BRETHREN
-
THE
MAIN
DIFFICULTY
WAS
HOW
TO
MAKE
THE
EXPEDITION
FROM
ENGLAND
WITHOUT
KILLING
THE
PATIENT
BEFORE
HE
COMPLETED
IT
-
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
OVERCOME
IN
AN
INTERESTING
MANNER

KING

WAS
A

TOOK
UP
HIS
GOLD

FATHER
HUNG
UPON
EVERY
WHEN

SAW
TRELAWNYS
PRINTED
LETTER
-
LORD
SIDNEY
WROTE
TO
DOUGLAS
KINNAIRD
SAYING
THAT
IT
WAS
INCORRECT
THROUGHOUT

IN
THE

OF

IN

STILL
MORE
THAT
HE
MIGHT
RETURN
TO
ENGLAND
-
OVERSHADOWING
HER
AGAIN
WITH
SPIRITUAL
AND
SOCIAL
PERIL
-
BUT
THIS
KIND
OF
RETURN
WAS
WHAT
SHE
COULD
NEVER
HAVE
FORESEEN
-
THAT
HE
-
SHOULD
COME
BACK
NOT
VOLUBLE
BUT
SILENT
-
NOT
BEAUTIFUL
BUT
DEFACED
-
NOT
IN
OBLOQUY
BUT
WITH
HIS
PRAISES
RINGING
-
SHE
COULD
REMEMBER
NOW
HIS
EXCITING
LAUGHTER
-
HIS
ALMOST
FILIAL
LOVE
FOR
HER
-
HER
ALMOST
MATERNAL
LOVE
FOR
HIM
-
ABOVE
ALL
SHE
COULD
REMEMBER
THE
ANGUISH
OF
THEIR
PARTING
-
AND
HOW
HE
HAD
BEEN
-
CONVULSED
-
ABSOLUTELY
CONVULSED
WITH
GRIEF
-
-
SO
LOVE
REVIVED
-
AND
IN
ITS
MOST
SENTIMENTAL
FORM
-
WHILE
HE
LIVED
SHE
HAD
LOST
TOUCH
IN
HER
PERPETUAL
ALARMS
BECAME
SACRED
TO
HER
-
SHE
FELT
ALMOST
AS
STRONGLY
AS
HOBHOUSE
-
ABOUT
BIOGRAPHIES
-
QUITE
APART
FROM
THE
DIVAGATIONS
OF
HER
-
POOR
BROTHER
-
-
SO
SHE
CONSTANTLY
REFERRED
TO
HIM
-
THERE
WERE
A
HUNDRED
REASONS
WHY
IT
WOULD
BE
OBJECTIONABLE
TO
HAVE
THE
FAMILY
HISTORY
EXPOSED
-
WHATEVER
LATITUDE
SHE
ALLOWED
IN
THE
WARMTH
OF
HER
KINDLY
NATURE
TO
OTHERS
-
OR
TO
HERSELF
-
SHE
BELIEVED
IMPLICITLY
IN
THE
MORAL
CODE
SHE
HAD
LEARNED
FROM
HER
GOOD
GRANDMOTHER
-
THE
COUNTESS
OF
SHE
HAD
NO
DESIRE
TO
SEE
IN
PRINT
THAT
HER
MOTHER
-
WHO
WAS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
A
DUCHESS
-
HAD
BEEN
INVOLVED
IN
A
SCANDALOUS
AND
RUINOUS
DIVORCE
-
THAT
HER
FATHER
-
-
MAD
JACK
BYRON
-
-
WAS
A
PROFLIGATE
AND
A
BANKRUPT
WHO
HAD
SQUANDERED
EVERY
PENNY
TWO
SUCCESSIVE
WIVES
HAD
BROUGHT
HIM
AND
LEFT
THE
SECOND
ON
THE
VERGE
OF
DESTITUTION
-
AND
THAT
HE
HAD
DIED
A
DRUNKARD
AND
PERHAPS
A
SUICIDE
-
HIDING
IN
FRANCE
TO
ESCAPE
HIS
CREDITORS
-
IT
WAS
NO
MORE
PLEASANT
FOR
THE
HON
AUGUSTA
LEIGH
TO
SHARE
THIS
KIND
OF
STORY
WITH
THE
WORLD
THAN
IT
WOULD
BE
FOR
MOST
20THCENTURY
LADIES
MOVING
IN
COURT
CIRCLES
AND
HAVING
CHILDREN
TO
BE
SETTLED
ADVANTAGEOUSLY
IN
LIFE
-
SHE
HAD
LIVED
DOWN
THE
RUMOURS
WHICH
HAD
MADE
THE
YEAR
OF
THE
BYRON
SEPARATION
A
NIGHTMARE
TO
HER
-
AND
SHE
HAD
ALSO
SUCCEEDED
-
THOUGH
WITH
AN
INCREASING
SENSE
OF
EFFORT
-
IN
PERSUADING
HER
LITTLE
WORLD
TO
AVERT
ITS
EYES
FROM
HER
HUSBAND
-
-
THAT
DRONE
-
-
AS
-
BYRON
CALLED
HIM
-
WHOSE
CAREER
OF
SHE
HAD
EARNED
THE
RIGHT
TO
BE
LEFT
IN
PEACE
-
BYRONS
FAME
WAS
-
OF
COURSE
-
VERY
WONDERFUL
-
BUT
IT
CARRIED
WITH
IT
TOO
MANY
REMINDERS
OF
HIS
TERRIBLE
INDISCRETIONS
-
THE
WRITING
OF
DON
JUAN
-
WHICH
SHE
HAD
NEVER
CEASED
TO
DEPLORE
-
HIS
SHOCKING
BLASPHEMIES
LIKE
THE
VISION
OF
JUDGEMENT
-
HIS
MAKING
FRIENDS
WITH
THE
ATHEIST
KNOWN
TO
HER
AS
-
THAT
INFAMOUS
MR
SHELLEY
-
-
AND
HIS
MIXING
WITH
REALLY
LOW
AND
HORRID
PEOPLE
SUCH
AS
THE
SUBVERSIVE
JOURNALIST
LEIGH
HUNT
-
WHOM
ON
WOULD
NEVER
CONCEIVABLY
MEET
IN
DECENT
SOCIETY
-
SHE
WAS
MOST
EMPHATICALLY
OPPOSED
TO
THE
PRODUCTION
OF
SHEER
INDELICACIES
-
AND
THAT
WAS
THE
LIGHT
IN
WHICH
SHE
SAW
THE
PROPOSED
BOOK
BY
DALLAS
-
LETTERS
BETWEEN
A
MOTHER
AND
A
SON
-
A
SON
SO
OUTSPOKEN
AND
A
MOTHER
SO
FAR
FROM
SUITABLE
TO
BE
PARADED
BEFORE
THE
PUBLIC
-
AND
BROUGHT
OUT
BY
THAT
SEEDY
POOR
RELATION
-
DALLAS
-
COULD
ANYTHING
BE
IN
WORSE
TASTE
-
HANSON
-
THE
SOLICITOR
-
WAS
NATURALLY
REMUNERATED
FOR
HIS
SERVICES
-
BUT
ALL
MR
HOBHOUSES
DUTIES
AS
EXECUTOR
WERE
PERFORMED
WITHOUT
REWARD
-
AND
NOW
THERE
WAS
MORE
TROUBLE
BREWING
WITH
THOSE
UNBEARABLE
DALLASES
-
DALLAS
SENIOR
WAS
DETAINED
IN
PARIS
BY
SEVERE
ILLNESS
-
BUT
DALLAS
JUNIOR
WAS
FULL
OF
FIGHT
AND
APPLYING
FOR
THE
INJUNCTION
TO
BE
LIFTED
-
HE
HAD
GONE
TO
BYRONS
COUSIN
-
NOW
7TH
LORD
-
AND
HAD
GOT
HIM
TO
COMPOSE
AN
AFFIDAVIT
TO
THE
EFFECT
THAT
-
WHEREAS
HE
HAD
FORMERLY
BEEN
RELUCTANT
TO
APPROVE
THE
PUBLICATION
UNLESS
IT
HAD
FIRST
BEEN
EXAMINED
BY
THE
RELATIVES
AND
FRIENDS
OF
HIS
PREDECESSOR
-
HE
HAD
NOW
READ
THE
BOOK
AND
WAS
CONTENT
FOR
IT
TO
BE
ISSUED
WITHOUT
THAT
PRECAUTION
-
THERE
WERE
FEW
THINGS
IN
AUGUSTAS
WHOLE
LIFE
-
FULL
OF
CALAMITIES
THOUGH
IT
WAS
-
THAT
HURT
HER
MORE
THAN
THIS
CONTEMPTUOUS
SLIGHT
FROM
GEORGE
ANSON
BYRON
-
WHOM
SHE
HAD
LOVED
WITH
AN
UNSWERVING
LOYALTY
-
AND
HAD
LOOKED
WAS
WITHOUT
THE
RIGHT
TO
MAKE
SUCH
PRONOUNCEMENTS
-
HE
HAD
INHERITED
NOTHING
FROM
HER
BROTHER
BUT
HIS
TITLE
-
WHEREAS
SHE
WAS
NOT
ONLY
OF
NEARER
CONSANGUINITY
BUT
THE
CHOSEN
RECIPIENT
OF
HIS
PROPERTY
-
THESE
-
IF
SHE
HAD
ONLY
KNOWN
IT
-
WERE
PRECISELY
THE
REASONS
WHY
HER
COUSIN
TOOK
PLEASURE
IN
THE
OPPORTUNITY
OF
ANNOYING
HER
-
LADY
BYRON
DID
NOT
LIKE
AUGUSTA
TO
HAVE
INTIMATE
FRIENDS
-
AND
IN
EVERY
INSTANCE
WHERE
THE
OCCASION
WAS
GRANTED
HER
-
SHE
MANAGED
TO
FIND
SOME
EXCUSE
FOR
BESTOWING
-
IN
WHOLE
OR
IN
PART
-
THOSE
CONFIDENCES
WHICH
NEVER
FAILED
TO
LEAVE
HER
AUDIENCE
AGAPE
WITH
WONDER
AT
HER
MAGNANIMITY
AND
AUGUSTAS
WICKEDNESS
-
GEORGE
ANSON
BYRON
HAD
SEEN
ENOUGH
OF
THE
POETS
ATROCIOUS
CONDUCT
AS
A
HUSBAND
TO
BE
AWARE
THAT
AUGUSTA
-
SO
FAR
FROM
BEING
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
COLLAPSE
OF
THE
MARRIAGE
-
HAD
BEEN
LADY
BYRONS
GREATEST
SUPPORT
AND
COMFORT
AT
THE
TIME
-
BUT
IT
HAD
BEEN
DEEMED
NECESSARY
ALL
THE
SAME
TO
ENLIGHTEN
HIM
AS
TO
THE
SUSPICIONS
IN
THE
BACKGROUND
-
AND
HE
HAD
REPEATED
THEM
TO
HIS
NEWLY
MARRIED
WIFE
-
HER
PRACTICALLY
ALL
HIS
MONEY
CAUSED
IT
TO
CRUMBLE
TO
OBLIVION
-
THOUGH
LADY
BYRON
KNEW
PERFECTLY
WELL
THAT
BYRON
-
AS
EARLY
AND
IT
CAME
AS
AN
APPALLING
SURPRISE
TO
CAPTAIN
BYRON
THAT
HE
HAD
BEEN
LEFT
WITHOUT
THE
FORTUNE
THAT
WOULD
KEEP
UP
THE
HEARING
ITS
CONTENTS
-
-
THE
VERY
THOUGHT
OF
IT
IS
PAINFUL
TO
ME
-
NEW
LADY
BYRON
-
HAD
SAID
ABOUT
IT
WAS
WRITTEN
ON
THE
FIRST
HALF
SHEET
OF
THE
SAME
PAPER
-
MY
DEAREST
ANNABELLA
-
THE
MORE
WE
CONSIDER
THE
MOST
PROMINENT
SUBJECT
IN
YOUR
LETTER
-
THE
MORE
WE
ARE
CONVINCED
OF
THE
TRUTH
OF
THAT
DREADFUL
HISTORY
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
MARRIAGE
AND
CHILDREN
WERE
1911
AND
1951
CENSUSES
-
THE
FORMER
HAD
ASKED
THE
AGE
OF
50
-
THE
1961
CENSUS
QUESTIONS
RELATED
TO
ALL
WOMEN
WHO
WERE
OR
HAD
BEEN
MARRIED
-
AND
SO
REPEATED
THE
ENQUIRY
MADE
FIFTEEN
YEARS
EARLIER
BY
THE
1946
FAMILY
CENSUS
CONDUCTED
ON
BEHALF
OF
THE
ROYAL
COMMISSION
ON
POPULATION
-
THE
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
CHILDREN
WERE
THE
SAME
AS
IN
1951
-
EXCEPT
THAT
THEY
EXTENDED
TO
ALL
WOMEN
WHO
WERE
OR
HAD
BEEN
MARRIED
-
IT
WAS
NOT
REGARDED
AS
PRACTICABLE
WITHIN
THE
LIMITS
OF
THE
CENSUS
TO
INCLUDE
PARTICULARS
ABOUT
THE
DATE
OF
BIRTH
OF
EACH
CHILD

AS
HAD
BEEN
DONE
IN
THE
SPECIALISED
ENQUIRY
FOR
THE
ROYAL
COMMISSION

THE
INNOVATION
AT
THE
1961
CENSUS
-
THOUGH
THE
FAMILY
CENSUS
HAD
PREVIOUSLY
INCLUDED
THE
QUESTION
-
WAS
THE
DATE
OF
TERMINATION
OF
THE
FIRST

THIS

TO
BE
MADE
OF
THEIR

AS

DURATION
OF

AND
NUMBER
OF
CHILDREN
IN
THE
CASE
OF
WOMEN
WHOSE
FIRST
OR

MARRIAGE
WAS
TERMINATED
BY
WIDOWHOOD
OR

AFTER
THE
END
IN
THE
SIZE
AND
PATTERN
OF

FOR
SUCCESSIVE
GENERATIONS
OVER
AS
LONG
A
PERIOD
AS
POSSIBLE

AS
THE
PROPORTION
OF

IN
THE
HIGHER
AGE
GROUPS
-
IN
WALES
AND
MONMOUTHSHIRE
THE
QUESTION
ON
THE
ABILITY
TO
SPEAK
WELSH
WAS
INCLUDED
AS
PREVIOUSLY
-
THE
QUESTION
WAS
FIRST
ASKED
IN
1891
-
AND
WAS
GIVEN
ITS
PRESENT
FORM
IN
1931
-
EACH
CENSUS
SINCE
THE
FIRST
IN
1801
HAS
INCLUDED
QUESTIONS
ABOUT

IN

THE

THE

OF
THE

TO
THE

THE

OF
PRIVATE

BY

OF
THEIR

HAS
BECOME
INCREASINGLY
IMPORTANT
-
PREVIOUSLY
-
WHILE
VISITORS
WERE
LEFT
OUT
OF
THIS

IT
WAS
NOT
CONSIDERED
SUFFICIENTLY
IMPORTANT
TO
ATTEMPT
THE

FROM

ABSENCE
OF

GIVEN
AT

BUT
THE
NEED
FOR
A
MORE
ACCURATE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
HOUSEHOLDS
BY
SIZE
AS
USUALLY
CONSTITUTED
HAD
BECOME
MORE
IMPORTANT
BY
1961
-
AND
ACCORDINGLY
A
NEW
QUESTION
WAS
INTRODUCED
-
-
THE
INFORMATION
COLLECTED
UNDER
THIS
HEAD
WILL
NOT
AFFECT
THE
MAIN
COUNT
OF

WILL
BE

TO
POSSIBILITIES
OF
REDUCING
THE
AMOUNT
OF

BEFORE

WE
HAVE
HELD
ELEVEN

WE
DECIDED
AS
A
FIRST
STEP
TO

INFORMATION
FROM
A
NUMBER
OF
ORGANISATIONS
AND
PERSONS
HAVING
AN
INTEREST
IN
THE
QUESTIONS
BEFORE
US
AND
AT
A
LATER
STAGE
WE
ARRANGED
FOR

OF
A

INVITING
ANYBODY
INTERESTED
TO
SUBMIT
REPRESENTATIONS
-
WE
COMPILED
A
LIST
OF
THE
POINTS
WHICH
WE
THOUGHT
WERE
OF
IMPORTANCE
-
BUT
WE
MADE
IT
CLEAR
THAT
THE
REPLIES

NOT
BE
CONFINED
TO
THESE

WE
FOUND
IT
AN
ADVANTAGE
IN
CERTAIN

THESE

-
ON
EXAMINATION
OF
THE

IT
BECAME
CLEAR
TO
US
THAT
CARBROMAL

WERE
EXAMPLES
OF
A

OF

ASCERTAINED

ACCEPTED
THIS

-
IN
VIEW
OF
THE
HEAVY
AND
DIRECT
RESPONSIBILITY
CARRIED
BY

WE
WERE
CONVINCED
THAT

ADDICTED
TO
THE
INHALATION

IF
I
TOOK
A

OF
A

ROUND
-
-
I
MUST
SAY
-
WAS
VERY
GOOD
ABOUT
IT
-
I
KNEW
HOW
MUCH
HE
PROBABLY
WANTED
TO
SLEEP
HIMSELF
-
BUT
-
ALMOST
GALLANTLY
-
HE
SAID
-
YOUNG
LEE
PROTESTED
-
CONSIDERATE
AS
ALWAYS
-
-
THAT
S
NOT
NECESSARY
IF
YOU

SIR

I
M

I
WONT
DO

-
-
NIGEL
LAUGHED
-
I
HAD
NOT
KNOWN
HE
WAS
SO
GOODNATURED
-
BUT
THEN
-
I
SUPPOSE
I
HAD
NEVER
GIVEN
HIM
SIMILAR
CAUSE
TO
DISPLAY
I
SLEPT
SOUNDLY
-
AND
MUCH
LATER
THAN
I
SHOULD
-
IT
DOWNSTAIRS
I
COULD
HEAR
THE
MURMUR
OF
VOICES
-
AND
KNEW
THEY
WERE
BACK
-
I
WONDERED

AS
I
WRAPPED
A
6SARONG
AROUND

-
IF
NIGEL
AT

AND
I
SAID
TO
MYSELF
-
OH
-
GOD
-
DOESNT
THE
BOY
EVER
RELAX
-
HE
TURNED
HIS
GAZE
AWAY
FROM
ME
ALMOST
INSTANTLY
-
BUT
IT
HAD
BEEN
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
ME
CONSCIOUS
OF
THE
PROBABLY
THOUGHT
MY
APPEARANCE
QUITE
A
BREACH
OF
THE
SOCIAL
GRACES
-
BUT
-
NATURALLY
-
HE
SAID
NOT
SO
MUCH
AS
A
WORD
ABOUT
IT
-
-
WE
VE
JUST
HAD
TEA
-

YOU

I
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN

IF

-
A
BACHELOR
HIMSELF
-
HE
KNEW

HOW
TO

HE
CAUGHT
MY

AND
PURSED
HIS
LIPS
IN
A
QUICK
LITTLE
GRIMACE
OF

-
THEN
RAISED
AN
ENQUIRING
EYEBROW
IN

DIRECTION
-
I
SHRUGGED
A
SHOULDER
-
LEE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
DECIDE
ABOUT
THAT
FOR
HIMSELF
-
I
THOUGHT
-
AND
NOTICED
THAT
ALTHOUGH
HE
WAS
LOOKING
AT
THE
OTHER
GIRL
-
HE
DID
SO
QUITE
DISPASSIONATELY
-
ALMOST
AS
THOUGH
HE
WAS
MERELY
INTERESTED
IN
THE
UNFAMILIAR
CLOTHES
SHE
WAS
WEARING
-
AND
I
THOUGHT
TO
MYSELF
-
HE
MAY
BE
STILL
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
-
NEW
CHUM
-
TO
SEE
-
THE

OF

-
-
THERE
WAS

WAS

I
FELT
THAT
I
COULD
HARDLY

VARIOUS

WONDERED
WHICH
OF

WAS

I

FELT
THE

WE
HAD
ONLY
A

THEN
DECIDED
TO
BATHE
AND
DRESS
FOR
A

HAD

ON

HIS

INDEED
I

PERSONALLY

THE

WAS

AS
HE
OCCASIONALLY
PROCLAIMED

HIS

HE

IT
AS

I

WILL
EVER
LEAVE
MALAYA
-
EVEN
WHEN
HE
RETIRES
-
THE

AND
HIS

HAVE
COME
TO

INDIRECTLY

AND
SHALLOW
FLIGHT
OF
MARBLE
STAIRS
-
SHE
BECAME
AWARE
OF
SOMEONE
WATCHING
HER
INTENTLY
-
AND
TURNING
IN
THAT
DIRECTION
-
SHE
SAW
OLIMPIA
-
THE
YOUNG
MAN
WAS
BENDING
OVER
HER
WITH
THE
ASSIDUITY
OF
A
LOVER
-
BUT
THE
GIRL
APPEARED
TO
BE
MORE
THROUGH
HALFCLOSED
EYES
-
THIS
WAS
A
SLIGHT
SHOCK
TO
YOUNG
MANS
PRESENCE
AT
THE
PALAZZO
-
-
ARE
YOU
ENJOYING
YOURSELF
-
OLIMPIA
-
-
SHE
HER
FAN
-
IN
PASSING
-
BUT
SHE
DID
NOT
WAIT
FOR
THE
ANSWER
-
DISTURBED
BY
VAGUE
UNEASINESS
-
SHE
WAS
WONDERING
WHETHER
OLIMPIA
HAD
BEEN
WATCHING
HER
TALK
WITH
ORSINI
-
SURELY
SHE
COULD
NOT
HAVE
OVERHEARD
ANYTHING
THEY
ON
THAT
POINT
-
FOR
SHE
WAS
CERTAIN
NO
ONE
HAD
BEEN
STANDING
NEAR
THEM
-
PUT
VITTORIA
ON
GUARD
-
-
SANTA
MARIA
-
THESE
SPYING
EYES
-
-
SHE
THOUGHT
-
BITTERLY
-
DORIA
WAS
CONTINUALLY
OBJECTS
OF
BEAUTY
OR
INTEREST
-
VITTORIA
-
ON
THE
INFORMATION
-
WHICH
HELD
NO
INTEREST
FOR
HER
-
-
-
NOW
THIS
SAPPHIRE

HAIR
OF
THE

AS
SHE
CROUCHED
FARNESE

WITH
A
SNIGGER

THE

CUCKOLD
CLAUDIUS
HAD
THE
LAST
WORD
-
AFTER
ALL
-
HE
KNEW
HOW
TO
DEAL
WITH
AN
ADULTEROUS
WIFE
-
EH
-
ORSINI
-
-
NOT
HEAR
IT
-
NOW
THEY
ENTERED
THE
LONG
GALLERY
WHERE
THEY
DISPERSED
AND
WANDERED
AROUND
-
ADMIRING
AND
COMMENTING
ON
THE
GLOWING
HUES
AND
BARBARIC
SPLENDOURS
OF
THE
TAPESTRIES
DORIA
HAD
BROUGHT
BACK
FROM
LEPANTO
-
AFTER
A
SHORT
INTERVAL
-
ORSINI
FOUND
AN
OPPORTUNITY
TO
REJOIN
VITTORIA
-
-
WE
MUST
TALK
FURTHER
-
-
HE
SAID
IN
A
LOW
URGENT
VOICE
-
-
WHERE
-
-
-
OLIMPIA
IS
WATCHING
US
-
THE
YOUNG
MAN
WITH
HER
IS
ORLANDO
CAVALCANTI

FRANCESCOS
FRIEND

-
ORSINI
SHOT
AN
IMPATIENT
GLANCE
AT
THE
COUPLE
-
-
THE
YOUNG
MAN
LOOKING
AT
US
-
NOW
I
MUST
KNOW
-
-
HE
WHISPERED
-
-
WHAT
YOU
MEANT
-
CARA
MIA
-
DO
YOU
WANT
YOUR
FREEDOM
IN
ORDER
TO
MARRY
-
-
HAD
TO
BEND
HIS
HEAD
TO
HEAR
-
-
I
WILL
NEVER
BE
ANY
MANS
MISTRESS
-
AS
TO
MARRYING
AGAIN
-
IF
I
WERE
FREE
-
THERE
IS
ONLY
ONE
MAN
I
WOULD
WISH
TO
MARRY
-
BUT
-
HE
-
LIKE
MYSELF
-
IS
NOW
BOUND
-
-
WITH
A
SWIFT
GESTURE
SHE
CLOSED
HER
FAN
AND
MOVED
AWAY
FROM
HIM
TOWARDS
THE
GROUP
IN
THE
CENTRE
OF
THE
GALLERY
-
LEAVING
HIM
STANDING
ALONE
-
AGAINST
THAT
GLOWING
-
BARBARIC
BACKGROUND
-
WITH
A
DEEPLY
THOUGHTFUL
EXPRESSION
ON
HIS
FACE
-
ON
A
BRIGHT
UNCLOUDED
MORNING
A
FEW
DAYS
AFTER
COACH
LEFT
THE
VILLA

LURCHED
OVER
THE
UNPAVED
TRACK
AND

TOWARDS
THE
RUINED
BATHS
OF
DIOCLETIAN
-
VITTORIA
-
ACCOMPANIED
BY
HER
MAID
-
LUCIA
-
WAS
ON
HER
DEBTS
-
LUCIA
WAS
THINKING
HOW
BEAUTIFUL
HER
MISTRESS
WITH
ITS
UNDERSKIRT
OF
ROSEBROCADE
FITTED
HER
THE
SPARKLING
SOCIETY
OF
THE
DORIA
PALACE
-
THE
FLATTERY
RESTLESS
SPIRIT
-
ALL
THREW
INTO
SHARP
RELIEF
THE
CONTRAST
OF
HER
GREY
LIFE
WITH
THE
SPLENDID
ONE
THAT
FILLED
TO
GIVE
HER
A
SEPARATE
ESTABLISHMENT
-
HE
INVARIABLY
PLEADED
HIS
FINANCIAL
DEPENDENCE
ON
HIS
UNCLE
-
WHO
HE
REMINDED
HER
THAT
THEY
MUST
ABIDE
BY
ROMAN
CUSTOM
-
AND
DWELL
THERE
WITH
THEIR
RELATIONS
-
HER
VALUES
WERE
THOSE
OF
THE
MATERIALIST
WHO
ASSESSES
EVERY
HUMAN
BEING
IN
TERMS
OF
FAME
-
POWER
AND
WEALTH
-
FRANCESCO
SHE
DESPISED
FOR
HIS
DULLNESS
-
HIS
LACK
OF
INITIATIVE
-
HIS
SUBSERVIENCE
TO
HIS
UNCLE
-
HER
HUSBANDS
GENTLENESS
AND
AMIABILITY
-
HIS
UNSELFISH
LOVE
FOR
HER
-
SHE
REGARDED
AS
SIGNS
OF
WEAKNESS
-
HE
WAS
A
FUTILE
CREATURE
WHO
HAD
NOT
EVEN
PROVED
CAPABLE
OF
GIVING
HER
A
CHILD
-
WHATEVER
PASSION
SHE
HAD
EXPERIENCED
IN
THE
FIRST
MONTHS
OF
MARRIAGE
HAD
BEEN
OUSTED
BY
CONTEMPT
-
SHE
HAD
NEVER
LOVED
HIM
-
HER
THOUGHTS
RUSHED
TO
ORSINI
-
SINCE
THE
MEETING
IN
THE
DORIA
PALACE
-
NO
WORD
HAD
COME
FROM
HIM
-
AND
THIS
SILENCE
OPPRESSED
HER
SPIRITS
WITH
A
WEIGHT
OF
MISGIVING
-
SHE
HAD
-
PERHAPS
-
DEMANDED
TOO
MUCH
-
THE
KISS
IN
THE
GARDEN
HAD
PLUMBED
UNSUS
PECTED
DEPTHS
IN
HER
-
AND
SHE
KNEW
THAT
INDEED
-
MATCH
HIS
-
EVERY
INSTINCT
URGED
HER
TO
TO
WHICH
HER
OWN
HAD
RESPONDED
AS
IT
HAD
RESPONDED
TO
NO
OTHER
HUMAN
BEING
-
PRUDENCE
-
AMBITION
AND
REASON
HAD
HELD
INSTINCT
IN
CHECK
-
AND
THEY
MUST
COMPROMISE
-
FOR
A
BRIEF
INTERVAL
SHE
ALLOWED
HERSELF
THE
LUXURY
OF
DREAMS
-
SHE
BEGAN
TO
IMAGINE
LIFE
AT
CONVERSATION
OF
POETS
AND
DILETTANTI
-
SHE
MENT

AND
HERSELF
ON
THE
DUCAL
DAIS
BESIDE
ORSINI
-
PLACING
A
CHAPLET
OF
ROSES
ON
THE
BROWS
THIS
REVERIE
WAS
RUDELY
ENDED
AS
THE
COACH
GAVE
A
THE
TWO
GIRLS
FROM
THEIR
SEATS
-
LUCIA
UTTERED
A
CRY
OF
ALARM
-
-
LOOK
-
MADONNA
-
WE
ARE
SURROUNDED
-
-
IT
WAS
TRUE
-
MEN
ARMED
WITH
PIKES
AND
DAGGERS
SWARMED
ABOUT
SHRIEKED
LUCIA
-
-
BANDITTI
-
-
VITTORIA
NOW
REALIZED
THAT
THEY
WERE
OUTSIDE
CROUCHING
IN
THE
DOORWAY
OF
THE
CHURCH
AND
EXHIBITING
LUCIA
-
-
SAID
VITTORIA
-
POINTING
TO
THE
BADGE
ON
THE
MANS
STARED
SPEECHLESSLY
AT
THE
GOLDEN
BEAR
-
VITTORIA
SWIFTLY
AVERTED
HER
HEAD
TO
AVOID
THE
IMPERTINENT
GLANCE
HER
THOUGHTS
AT
THIS
MOMENT
WERE
CHAOTIC
-
THE
COACH
NOW
TURNED
IN
ANOTHER
DIRECTION
-
TOWARDS
THE
WILD
AND
DESOLATE
REGION
BEHIND
THE
BATHS
-
IT
WAS
SPARSELY
INHABITED
-
DOTTED
WITH
FALLOW
FIELDS
AND
TERRACED
VINEYARDS
-
AND
HERE
AND
THERE
JUTTED
A
BROWN
OUTCROP
OF
FLOWERWREATHED
RUINS
-
A
PATHETIC
REMINDER
OF
ROMES
FORMER
GREATNESS
-
IN
THIS
REGION
OF
MONTI
MOST
OF
THE
PUBLIC
BATHS
HAD
BEEN
BUILT
IN
THE
TIME
OF
THE
CAESARS
-
BUT
WITH
THE
BREAKING
OF
THE
AQUEDUCTS
DURING
THE
BARBARIAN
INVASIONS
THE
BATHS
HAD
LOST
THEIR
PURPOSE
-
THEY
HAD
BECOME
USED
THESE
QUARRIES
AS
HIDING
PLACES
-
TO
THE
DANGER
OF
TRAVELLERS
IN
THE
DISTRICT
-
AS
THEY
LUMBERED
PAST
AT
A
RATTLING
PACE
-
VITTORIA
COULD
SEE
A
WISP
OF
SMOKE
CURLING
ABOVE
THE
FIRE
OF
A
GYPSY
ENCAMPMENT
AND
A
FEW
TATTERDEMALION
CREATURES
GATHERED
ABOUT
IT
-
COOKING
THEIR
FRUGAL
MEAL
-
THESE
WERE
LEFT
FAR
BEHIND
-
AN
OLD
MAN
BELABOURING
AN
LUCIA
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
THE
ONLY
LIVING
CREATURES
ON
AN
EMPTY
PLANET
-
AFTER
THE
INITIAL
SHOCK
-
VITTORIA
FELT
CALM
-
SHE
KNEW
EXACTLY
WHAT
SHE
WANTED
-
AND
WAS
PREPARED
TO
TAKE
IT
WITHOUT
SCRUPLE
-
IF
SHE
COULD
-
WHAT
SHE
HAD
FORGOTTEN
IN
HER
SELFABSORPTION
IN
HER
OWN
SCHEMES
WAS
THAT
OTHER
PEOPLE
WERE
EQUALLY
ABSORBED
IN
THEIR
SCHEMES
-
WHICH
WERE
LIKELY
TO
THIS
MOVE
TODAY
WAS
A
REMINDER
OF
THAT
FACT
-
WHILST
SHE
AUTOMATICALLY
PATTED
THE
HAND
OF
THE
AGITATED
LUCIA
-
HER
BRAIN
WAS
WORKING
RAPIDLY
-
AND
SHE
DECIDED
THAT
SHE
MUST
BE
DIFFICULT
THOUGH
THAT
WOULD
BE
-
SHE
BECAME
AWARE
THAT
THE
PACE
WAS
SLACKENING
-
THE
MOMENT
HAD
COME
-
UPON
THE
ENSUING
INTERVIEW
HER
HEART
WAS
BEATING
FAST
-
AND
THE
PALMS
OF
HER
HANDS
WERE
DAMP
-
ORSINIS
HIGHCROWNED
HAT
WITH
ITS
JAUNTY
PLUME
BLOTTED
OUT
THE
LIGHT
-
HIS
HAND
LANGUAGE
-
-
YES
-
BUT
MAKE
IT
WORTH
HER
WHILE
-
-
-
I
SEE
-
I
KNOW
HOW
TO
DEAL
WITH
PEOPLE
LIKE
THAT
-
-
AND
TURNING
TO
THE
COWERING
LUCIA
-
HE
SPOKE
IN
HER
LUCIA
WAS
REGARDING
HIM
AS
A
RABBIT
LOOKS
AT
A
STOAT
-
THRUSTING
HIS
HEAD
FARTHER
INTO
THE
COACH
-
HE
SAID
SOMBRELY
-
-
HAVE
YOU
EVER
HEARD
OF
A
PUNISHMENT
CALLED
HEARD
OF
IT
-
THE
ORSINI
GIVE
THAT
TO
TRAITORS
-
THERE
IS
NO
ESCAPING
THE
VENGEANCE
OF
AN
ORSINI
-
WE
HUNT
A
TRAITOR
DOWN
TO
THE
ENDS
OF
THE
EARTH
-
AND
NO
POWER
CAN
SAVE
HIM
-
OR
HER
-
DO
YOU
UNDERSTAND
-
-
CONTINUED

GIVING
HER
A
KEEN
LOOK
-
-
THE
ORSINI
ARE
GENEROUS
TO
THOSE
WHO
SERVE
THEM
FAITHFULLY
-
SPEECH
-
HE
TURNED
TO
VITTORIA
-
SITTING
ERECT
-
WITH
FLUSHED
CHEEKS
AND
EYES
SPARKLING
WITH
BE
SO
GOOD
AS
TO
ORDER
YOUR
MEN
NOT
TO
MOLEST
MY
NEVERTHELESS
-
TO
THE
MAN
WHO
HAD
PEERED
INTO
THE
COACH
-
WHOM
HE
HAD
ADDRESSED
AS
LUIGI
-
AND
GAVE
HIM
SHARP
INSTRUCTIONS
ON
THE
MATTER
-
VITTORIA
STOOD
LOOKING
ABOUT
HER
-
BREATHING
THE
SCENT
OF
THYME
-
THE
LAND
AT
HER
FEET
SLOPED
AWAY
INTO
A
TINY
VALLEY
BEYOND
WHICH
-
ON
THE
CREST
OF
A
WOODED
HILLSIDE
-
THE
RUINS
OF
A
SMALL
TEMPLE
WERE
ETCHED
AGAINST
THE
CLEAR
BLUE
OF
THE
SKY
-
HE
FORGOT
TIME
AND
PLACE
-
HE
-
THE
MASTER
-
WAS
GENTLY
LED
ALONG
EROTIC
PATHS
WHICH
HE
KNEW
EXISTED
-
BUT
HAD
NEVER
TRODDEN
-
HE
LEARNED
HOW
TO
USE
HIS
HANDS
-
HOW
TO
ADORE
THAT
BODY
WITHOUT
HASTE
-
HOW
TO
CARESS
EVERY
INCH
WITH
HIS
MOUTH
AS
WELL
-
TO
CREEP
DOWN
ALONG
HER
SMOOTH
MUSCLES
TILL
HE
LOST
HIMSELF
IN
A
RAPTURE
OF
KISSES
IN
PLACES
HE
D
DREAMED
OF
-
WHERE
LIFE
BEGAN
TO
OOZE
AND
QUICKENED
HIS
HEART
BEAT
TO
A
THUNDER
-
HE
LOOKED
AT
HER
-
HEAD
THROWN
BACK
IN
A
POOL
OF
HAIR
-
HER
BLOODRED
LIPS
PARTED
AND
THE
BEATING
OF
HER
HEART
IN
THE
FULL
THROAT
-
HER
MOUTH
DID
THINGS
HE
THOUGHT
NO
HUMAN
BEING
COULD
STAND
WITHOUT
DYING
-
BUT
HE
WENT
ON
LIVING
IN
AN
OCEAN
OF
VOLUPTUOUSNESS
-
THAT
SWELLED
AND
EBBED
OVER
HIM
-
UNDER
HIM
-
IN
HIM
AND
THROUGH
HIM
-
HE
WAS
HAVING
A
BALL
-
HE
TWIDDLED
THE
TV
SET
WITH
SHAKING
HANDS
-
SHE
SAT
CALMLY
ON
THE
BED
SMOKING
A
CIGARETTE
-
HIS
FACE
WAS
WHITE
WITH
TWO
RED
WAS
THAT
ANY
BETTER
-
YOU
KNOW
IT
WAS
-
YOU
DONT
NEED
TEACHING
-
ONLY
A
LITTLE
COAXING
-
HE
SAT
DOWN
AND
RAN
HIS
FINGER
DOWN
ALONG
HER
SPINE
-
DO
YOU
LOVE
ME
NOW
-
LIKE
YESTERDAY
-
I
M
TO
SATISFY
MY
PHYSICAL
WANTS
DOES
NOT
CHANGE
THAT
-
BEFORE
LONG
YOU
LL
GIVE
ME
THE
SATISFACTION
THAT
LL
SET
ME
ROCKING
ON
MY
FEET
-
BUT
I
LL
STILL
BE
ONLY
FOND
OF
YOU
-
BUT
YOU
WOULDNT
MARRY
ME
-
NO
-
I
M
NOT
YOUR
TYPE
-
I
D
MAKE
YOU
MISERABLE
-
I
MEAN
THAT
-
I
D
VERY
PROBABLY
BE
UNFAITHFUL
AND
THAT
D
KILL
YOU
-
THEN
I
D
BE
UNFAITHFUL
TOO
-
TO
TEACH
SPITE
ME
-
I
WOULD
NEVER
DO
IT
FOR
THAT
REASON
-
TO
ME
IT
D
BE
IMMATERIAL
WHETHER
YOU
D
RETALIATE
OR
NOT
-
YOU
D
GO
CRAZY
IF
THAT
SITUATION
AROSE
-
TO
OBSERVE
THE
COLOUR
RISE
IN
HER
CHEEK
AND
HEAR
HER
BREATH
COME
FASTER
-
TO
SEE
THE
SLIGHT
BEADS
OF
SWEAT
COME
OUT
ON
HER
GLISTENING
SKIN
AND
SEE
HER
MOVE
WITH
UNCONTROLLED
RHYTHM
-
TO
HAVE
HER
TWIST
IN
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
RECEIVE
A
CARESS
HE
WAS
PURPOSELY
WITHHOLDING
-
TO
HEAR
HER
DEEPTHROATED
MOAN
OF
FULL
SATISFACTION
AND
FEEL
HER
SHIVERING
-
CLAWING
SURRENDER
-
NOT
SO
DUSTY
-
SHE
MIGHT
SAY
AFTERWARDS
-
DRAWING
AT
A
CIGARETTE
-
IT
S
A
WOW
-
HE
SAID
-
SHE
KISSED
HIM
MOTHERLY
-
YOU
JUST
WAIT
TILL
YOU
TEACH
THE
GIRL
YOU
REALLY
LOVE
-
HE
DIDNT
PROTEST
ANY
MORE
TO
SAY
HE
LOVED
HER
BECAUSE
HE
KNEW
IT
TO
BE
UNTRUE
-
INSTEAD
HE
SAID
-
WILL
THAT
BE
BETTER
-
SHE
NODDED
-
IT
S
MANS
NATURE
TO
TEACH
AND
TO
TEACH
THOSE
WE
LOVE
IS
DOUBLE
PLEASURE
-
AND
SHE
LIGHTS
ON
-
YOU
LOSE
HALF
THE
FUN
WHEN
YOU
FUMBLE
IN
THE
DARK
-
SHE
HAD
MANY
DIRECT
COMMENTS
LIKE
THAT
-
ONCE
SHE
QUIETLY
PUSHED
HIM
BACK
WHEN
HE
KISSED
HER
TOO
FULLY
AND
TOO
SOON
-
OI

NOT
YET
-
YOU
OAF
-
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
MY
MOUTH
IS
-
A
BILLPOSTERS
BUCKET
TO
BE
PLUNGED
IN
AT
RANDOM
-
HE
D
LEARNED
TO
LAUGH
WHEN
SOMETHING
WENT
WRONG
OR
THE
SITUATION
BECAME
LUDICROUS
-
AS
WHEN
THEY
WERE
BOTH
CAUGHT
IN
THE
RAW
WHEN
HE
D
FORGOTTEN
TO
LOCK
HIS
DOOR
AND
DEREK
HAD
WALKED
IN
UNEXPECTEDLY
-
THEY

JUST
HAD
TIME
TO

INTO
THE

FOR
FIFTEEN
MINUTES
WHILE

BACK
TO
THE
SUBJECT
OF
HER
MARRIAGE
AND
ASKED
HER
WHY

GOING
TO
MARRY
HER
SCULPTOR

IS
-
HE
S
SO
GREAT
I
M
A
BIT
SCARED
OF
HIM

A
WOMAN
MUST
BE
A
BIT
SCARED
TO
BE
REALLY
IN
LOVE
-
THAT
S
WHY
YOU
COULD
NEVER
LOVE
ME
-
CORRECT
-
DUCKY
-
YOU
JUST
WAIT
TILL
GOD

IT
LL
MAKE
YOU
FEEL
LIKE
ONE
-
YOU
THINK
THAT
SCULPTOR
S
A
GOD
-
PERHAPS
-
IN
A
WAY
-
ALL
I
KNOW
IS
HEART
BEAT
IN
HER
THROAT
-
BUT
HOW
ABOUT
THE
PHYSICAL
SIDE
-
YOU
RE
QUITE
AN
EROTIC
LITTLE
BEAST
-
CAN
HE
SATISFY
THAT
-
YOU
YOUNGSTERS
ALWAYS
OVERESTIMATE
YOURSELVES
-
YOU
CAN
TAKE
IT
FROM
ME
THAT
HE
CAN
AND
DOES
-
BUT
EVEN
IF
HE
WERE
IMPOTENT
I
D
STILL
LOVE
AND
WANT
HIM
-
THERE
ARE
SIDES
TO
ME
YOU
LL
NEVER

-
DONT
YOU
FEEL
GUILTY
LIVING
WITH
ME

DONT
YOU

MARY
HAD
MARRIED
HER
BILL
BROKER
SOME
TIME
AGO
AND
HE
NOW
SHUDDERED
WHEN
HE
REMEMBERED
THE
CLINICAL
WEEKENDS
HE
USED
TO
SPEND
WITH
HER
-
HE
OFTEN
USED
TO
TRY
TO
IMAGINE
HER
REACTIONS
IF
HE
HAD
ONCE
TREATED
HER
AS
HE
DID
CHARLIE
-
BUT
HIS
IMAGINATION
FAILED
-
THE
EFFICIENT
LITTLE
MARY
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
CALLED
IT
A
SHOCKING
WASTE
OF
TIME
AT
HOME

SATISFIED
TO
HAVE

RIGHT
FROM
THE

REALLY
SEEN
CAXTONS
HAND
SNATCHING
AT
THE

HOLDING
THE

HE
COULD
NEVER

NOT
BE

THE
NOSE
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
PAINSENSITIVE
ORGANS
IN
THE
HUMAN
BODY
-
AND
MALONE
WAS
DISCOVERING
THE
TRUTH
IN
SCIENTIFIC
DETAIL

KENNAN
HAD
ONLY
THE
BLOW
TOOK
THE
WRITHING
THUG
A
FRACTION
ABOVE
THE

KNOB
WHICH
LANDMARKED
THE

THE
VITAL
NERVECENTRE
WHICH
A
LONGAGO
MARINE
INSTRUCTOR
HAD
DECLARED
THE
PINNACLE
OF
UNARMED
COMBAT
TARGETS

THE
THUG
COLLAPSED
WITH
A
WHISTLING
MOAN

AND

TORE
THE
LUGER
FROM
THE
MANS
SUDDENLY
LIMP
HAND

THERE
WAS
NO

FOR
REJOICING

HE
THREW
HIMSELF
ACROSS
THE
FLOOR
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
TO
BE
SAID
-
HE
LIFTED
HIS
GLASS
AND
DRAINED
IT
-
FEELING
THE
SWEAT
BREAKING
OUT
ON
THE
PALMS
OF
HIS
HANDS
-
WHEN
AT
LAST
HE
LOOKED
UP
SHE
WAS
STANDING
RIGHT
IN

SMILING
AS
IF
NOTHING

SEVERAL
TIMES

CHEERFULLY

STING
YOU
FOR
A
DOUBLE
FOR
BEING
A
NAUGHTY

HOW
ABOUT
THE
TELLY
TOMORROW
AFTERNOON

FELT
A
GLOW
OF
HAPPINESS
STEAL
OVER
HIM

EVERYTHING

ALL
RIGHT
NOW

THANK
GOD

SHE
WASNT
GOING
TO
BREAK
WITH
HIM
-
AFTER
ALL

FOR
THE
MOMENT
IT
WAS
THE
ONLY
THING
IN
THE
WORLD
THAT
MATTERED

-
OF

KITTY

HE
SAID
FERVENTLY

HIS
EYES
MISTY
WAVING
HER
HAND
TO
HIM
-
HARRY
FOLLOWED
HIM
TO
THE
DOOR
-
OPENED
IT
FOR
HIM
AND
STOOD
OUTSIDE
ON
THE
STEP
-
LOOKING
UP
AT
THE
SKY
-
WHERE
A
FEW
PALE
STARS
SHONE
BETWEEN
PUFFS
OF
LIGHT
CUMULUS
CLOUD
-
-
NICE
NIGHT
-
-
HE
REMARKED
AFFABLY
-

BUT
THEY
FORECAST
RAIN
PULLING
ON
HIS
GLOVES
AND
ADJUSTING
HIS
HAT

LOOK

BOB

HE
JERKED
HIS
THUMB
OVER
HIS
SHOULDER
-
-
THAT
GIRL
S
NOTHING
BUT
A
LOAD
ALL
RIGHT
-
-
BONE
CONTRADICTED
FLATLY
-
-
IT
S
WE
COULD
GET
RID
OF
HIM

HARRY
NODDED
HIS
GRIZZLED
HEAD
LIKE
AN
OLD
HOUND
-
-
YOU
RE
RIGHT
THERE
-
BOB
-
-
HE
MUTTERED
-
-
BUT
IT
S
EASIER
SAID
THAN
DONE
-
KITTY
ENCOURAGES
HIM
-
TOO
-
NO
WORK
-
NO
BACKGROUND
-
NO
REGULAR
MONEY
SO
FAR
AS
I
BUT
THERE
YOU
ARE
-
THE
GIRL
S
WILD
AND
-
I
WONT
MAKE
A
FOOL
OF
MYSELF
-
ALWAYS
BE
THAT
-
-
HE
PAUSED
-
HATRED
OF
STEVIE
HEWITT
RISING
LIKE
GALL
IN
HIS
THROAT
-
THAT
CHAP
-
HEWITT
-
TOO
-
LEAVE
IT
TO
ME
-
-
SAID
IN
A
LOW
VOICE
-
BONE
HALF
SMILED
5PESOLED
SHOES
MAKING
NO
SOUND
ON
THE
ASPHALT
SURFACE
-
AS
HE
WALKED
HE
CONCENTRATED
ON
THE
PROBLEM
OF
STEVIE
HEWITT
-
BY
COMPARISON
WITH
THE
MANNER
IN
WHICH
HE
HAD
DISPATCHED
HENRY
MANSELL
THE
ELIMINATION
OF
A
LITTLE
SPIV
FROM
BRIGHTON
SEEMED
AN
EASY
UNDERTAKING
-
ONCE
HE
D
SET
HIS
MIND
TO
IT
-
BACK
AT
THE
COTTAGE
HE
PREPARED
HIS
SUPPER
AND
ATE
IT
BESIDE
THE
FIRE
IN
THE
LIVINGROOM
-
HIS
THOUGHTS
ONCE
MORE
ON
KITTY
-
IF
SHE
WAS
REALLY
IN
LOVE
WITH
STEVIE
HEWITT
IT
WAS
MADNESS
TO
GO
ON
WORRYING
ABOUT
HER
-
HE
TOLD
HIMSELF
MOODILY
-
YET
IT
WAS
NOT
AS
CLEARCUT
AS
THAT
-
HE
NOT
ONLY
FELT
HIS
NEED
OF
HER
BUT
WAS
EQUALLY
AWARE
OF
THE
NECESSITY
TO
HELP
AND
PROTECT
HER
-
EVEN
AGAINST
HER
WILL
-
TONIGHT
-
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
-
HE
HAD
ABANDONED
ALL
PRETENCE
AND
SHOWN
HER
THE
HONEST
DESPERATION
OF
HIS
FEELING
FOR
HER
-
SHE
HAD
NEITHER
ENCOURAGED
NOR
COMPLETELY
REJECTED
HIM
-
IN
SOME
PERVERSE
WAY
THEIR
BRIEF
QUARREL
HAD
FORGED
A
BOND
BETWEEN
THEM
-
NO
DOUBT
SHE
HAD
EVERY
INTENTION
OF
KEEPING
BOTH
OF
THEM
ON
A
STRING
-
ON
THE
WHOLE
HE
PROBABLY
HAD
A
SLIGHT
ADVANTAGE
OVER
THE
YOUNG
MAN
-
INASMUCH
AS
HE
HAD
MONEY
TO
SPEND
AND
SHE
WAS
A
GIRL
WHO
HAD
A
HEALTHY
BUT
HE
WAS
STILL
NO
SORT
OF
MATCH
FOR
A
YOUNG
AND
VIRILE
COMPETITOR
AND
HE
KNEW
IT
-
HE
TURNED
AWAY
AND
BEGUN
TO
UNDRESS
-
SHIVERING
WITH
THE
COLD
-
HIS
EYE
AUTOMATICALLY
GLANCED
TOWARDS
THE
PANEL
WHICH
CONCEALED
THE
HIDINGPLACE
OF
HIS
SECRET
TREASURE
-
FOR
AN
INSTANT
HE
STOOD
TRANSFIXED
TO
THE
FLOOR
-
HIS
EYES
UNWAVERING
AS
THEY
RIVETED
THEMSELVES
ON
THE
WALL
-
WAS
IT
HIS
IMAGINATION
OR
WAS
THE
PANEL
SLIGHTLY
LOPSIDED
-
LEAPING
FORWARD
WITH
A
CHOKED
SOUND
HE
GRASPED
THE
OBLONG
PANEL
AND
PULLED
IT
OUT
-
THE
BLACK
TIN
BOX
WAS
EXACTLY
AS
HE
HAD
LEFT
IT
-
WITH
HEAVILY
BEATING
HEART
HE
REACHED
OUT
AND
LIFTED
THE
LID
-
EVERYTHING
WAS
INTACT
AND
HE
GASPED
WITH
RELIEF
-
HE
LIFTED
OUT
THE
HEAVY
BUNDLES
OF
NOTES
AND
KNELT
ON
THE
FLOOR
THAT
FIFTY
POUNDS
FOR
KITTY
-
OBVIOUSLY
HE
HAD
BEEN
CARELESS
IN
REPLACING
THE
PANEL
-
BUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
ANYONE
HAVING
DISCOVERED
HIS
HIDINGPLACE
GAVE
HIM
SOMETHING
OF
A
SHOCK
-
BOX
FROM
ITS
HIDINGPLACE
AND
LOCKED
IT
INSIDE
THE
CUPBOARD
-
IT
WOULD
BE
SAFER
UNDER
LOCK
AND
KEY
FOR
THE
TIME
BEING
THAN
BEHIND
A
PIECE
HEAVY
PADLOCK
FOR
THE
BOX
AND
SEARCH
COLD
AND
UNEASY
-
UNABLE
TO
ACCOUNT
WHEN
HE
CLOSED
HIS
EYES
IT
WAS
HENRY
MANSELLS
FACE
HE
SAW
-
HOVERING
ABOVE
HIS
HEAD
LIKE
A
HIDEOUS
CARICATURE
-
THE
PARROT
NOSE
AND
STRAIGHT
LINE
OF
THE
MOUTH
-
THE
PITILESS
BLUE
EYES
THAT
SEEMED
TO
STRIP
HIM
RIGHT
DOWN
TO
HIS
ABJECTLY
QUAKING
BONES
-
THE
MOULDERING
HORROR
THAT
HAD
ONCE
BEEN
HENRY
MANSELL
TAUNTED
HIM
NOW
IN
THE
SILENT
DARKNESS
-
HAWKESHURST
THAT
FRIDAY
NIGHT
HUGH
MANSELL
AND
RODDY
DOWELL
DRANK
THEIR
BEER
AND
WAITED
-
-
IT
S
TOO
DAMN
BUSY
IN
HERE
-
WE
CANT
EXPECT
HIM
TO
LEAVE
HIS
CUSTOMERS
-
-
HUGH
SAID
MOROSELY
-
-
GIVE
HIM
A
CHANCE
-
OLD
CHAP
-
HE
LL
BE
OVER
-
JIM
S
A
MOST
RELIABLE
CHAP
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
PICKING
UP
A
SMALL
TIP
-
-
ORDERED
TWO
MORE
BEERS
-
-
I
M
REALLY
BEGINNING
TO
FEEL
IT
S
ALL
A
BIT
OF
A
WASTE
OF
TIME
-
ANYWAY
-
I
VE
BEEN
COLLECTING
SCRAPS
OF
EVIDENCE
AND
PIECING
THEM
TOGETHER
FOR
FOUR
MONTHS
NOW
-
AND
THE
WHOLE
LOT
STILL
DOESNT
AMOUNT
TO
ANYTHING
ONE
COULD
CALL
CONCRETE
-
-
WHY
I
WANT
YOU
TO
MEET
THIS
BIRD
-
I
THINK
HE
FILLS
IN
AN
IMPORTANT
PART
OF
THE
BACKGROUND
-
FURTHERMORE

DEAR

IT
CONFIRMS
WHAT
WE
ALREADY

OF
YOUR
FATHERS
INTENTION

THE
COUNTRY
ON
THE
NIGHT
OF
OCTOBER
14TH
-
-
HUGH
NODDED
-
HIS
FACE
WORE
THE
MELANCHOLY
EXPRESSION
THAT
WAS
HABITUAL
TO
HIM
BUT
HIS
EYES
SHOWED
HIS
INNER
EXCITEMENT
-
-
I
KNOW
-
BUT
FROM
THE
MOMENT
HE
WALKED
OUT
OF
HERE
WE
HAVENT
A
SHRED
OF
EVIDENCE
TO
PROVE
WHAT
HAPPENED
-
OBVIOUSLY
HE
MET
SOMEONE
-
EITHER
BY
CHANCE
OR
BY
ARRANGEMENT
-
WHICHEVER
WAY
IT
WAS
-
THAT
PERSON
HAD
A
GUN
AND
HE
MANAGED
TO
PERSUADE
FATHER
TO
DRIVE
ALONG
THAT
QUIET
STRETCH
OF
ROAD
-
-
-
YOU
KNOW
-
WHOEVER
IT
WAS
MIGHT
HAVE
KNOWN
OF
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THE
SUICIDE
LETTER
-
PROVIDING
HIM
WITH
HIS
UNCLE
-
BUT
SAID
NOTHING
-
AFTER
ALL
-
JULIAN
HAD
ACTED
VERY
STRANGELY
SINCE
THE
TRAGEDY
-
ALWAYS
SECRETIVE
-
ALWAYS
RELUCTANT
TO
DISCUSS
HIS
BROTHERS
COLDBLOODED
MURDER
BUT
-
IN
FACT
-
HENRY
MANSELLS
DEATH
HAD
SAVED
THE
FIRM
AND
JULIANS
FUTURE
-
MOREOVER
HE
MIGHT
WELL
HAVE
BEEN
AWARE
OF
HIS
BROTHERS
INTENTION
TO
SKIP
OUT
OF
THE
COUNTRY
AND
-
EASY
ENOUGH
ALONG
THAT
STRETCH
OF
COAST
ROAD
IN
WINTER
-
THE
NEXT
BOAT
ACROSS
THE
CHANNEL
AND
HAS
BEEN
LYING
LOW
WITH
THE
MONEY
SOMEWHERE
-
-
HUGH
NODDED
-
-
I
REALIZED
THAT
AFTER
MY
TALK
WITH
MRS
LAWFORD
-
THERE
ARE
A
DOZEN
COUNTRIES
WHERE
A
MAN
COULD
EASILY
HIDE
UP
AND
CHANGE
THE
MONEY
WITHOUT
DANGER
-
UNLESS
WE
CAN
GET
A
DEFINITE
LINE
ON
HIM
IT
S
CRIED
OUT
IN
EXASPERATION
-
-
I
VE
PUT
EVERYTHING
I
KNOW
BEFORE
THEM
-
-
-
-
THEY
RE
BOUND
TO
WANT
PRETTY
SOLID
NEW
EVIDENCE
THEIR
POINT
OF
VIEW
THE
EVIDENCE
FOR
SUICIDE
IS
OVERWHELMING
-
I
SPOKE
TO
A
CHAP
FROM
THE
OFFICE
OF
THE
DIRECTOR
OF
PUBLIC
PROSECUTIONS
I
KNOW
PRETTY
WELL
-
AND
HE
AGREED
THAT
THE
MISSING
CASH
IS
BUT
AS
HE
QUITE
REASONABLY
POINTED
OUT
THE
MONEY
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
DISPOSED
OF
IN
LONDON
BEFORE
YOUR
FATHER
LEFT
THAT
EVENING
-
IT
WOULDNT
BE
UNNATURAL
FOR
A
MAN
IN
HIS
POSITION
TO
MAKE
PROVISION
FOR
AN
UNKNOWN
DEPENDENT
OR
SETTLE
WHAT
HE
REGARDED
AS
PARTICULAR
DEBTS
OF
HONOUR
BEFORE
TAKING
HIS
OWN
MONEY
COULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
PINCHED
BY
SOMEONE
PASSING
THE
CAR
AFTER
YOUR
FATHER
WAS
DEAD
-
KIND
OF
CRIME
IN
THE
BOOK
-
THERE
S
NOTHING
THAT
ABSOLUTELY
TIES
THE
MISSING
MONEY
TO
THE
THE
POINT
-
SAME
WITH
THE
PASSPORT
-
IT
S
GONE
AND
THAT
S
THAT
-
IT
MAY
TURN
UP
IN
A
DUSTBIN
SOMEWHERE
OR
AT
THE
BACK
OF
A
DRAWER
-
AS
FAR
AS
THE
POLICE
ARE
CONCERNED
THERE
S
NOTHING
IN
OUR
OWN
MINDS
WE
MAY
BE
PRETTY
SURE
WHAT
HAPPENED
-
BUT
THAT
S
NOT
GOOD
ENOUGH
FOR
THEM
-
THAT
SUICIDE
LETTER
DID
THE
TRICK
-
DEFINITE
PROOF
THAT
YOUR
FATHER
TOOK
HIS
LIFE
-
BACKED
BY
MEDICAL
EVIDENCE
AND
THE
FINGERPRINT
CHAPS
-
-
A
LITTLE
MAN
WITH
THIN
BROWN
HAIR
AND
A
RUDDY
COMPLEXION
CAME
OVER
AND
GREETED
THEM
-
PAPER
-
-
THE
MAN
SAID
TO
HUGH
IN
A
THICK
VOICE
WHICH
BORE
TRACES
OF
A
COCKNEY
ACCENT
-
-
I
WAS
TELLING
YOUR
FRIEND
HOW
HE
COME
IN
HERE
THE
VERY
NIGHT
HE
PASSED
AWAY
-
-
HUGH
WASNT
IMPRESSED
WITH
THIS
INGRATIATING
BAR
MAN
WHOM
RODDY
HAD
RAKED
UP
-
HE
WAS
SEEDY
AND
MIDDLEAGED
WITH
SMALL
BLACK
EYES
SET
CLOSE
TO
GETHER
BENEATH
HEAVILY
MARKED
BROWS
AND
A
SLY
-
-
HE
WAS
HITTING
THE
BOTTLE
PRETTY
HARD
-
SIR
-
-
THE
MAN
SAID
IN
A
LOUD
WHISPER
-
-
MEANING
NO
OFFE
NCE
-
-
HE
ADDED
-
LOOKING
AT
HUGH
-
A
LOT
TO
YOU
-
BUT
I
M
DAMNED
IF
I
CAN
SEE
THE
REASON
-
IT
S
NOT
AS
IF
YOU
WERE
ALL
THAT
FOND
OF
ALICE
-
-
HE
WAS
INTERRUPTED
BY
THE
WENT
ON
-
IF
HE
DIDNT
DO
IT
IT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
-
-
-
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
WITH
ALL
MY
HEART
TO
TELL
HIM
-
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
DO
IT
-
AS
LONG
AS
MY
SUSPICION
REMAINED
IN
MY
HEAD
I
COULD
PRETEND
TO
MYSELF
-
IN
MOMENTS
OF
OPTIMISM
-
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
TRUE
-
EVEN
IF
YOU
RE
WRONG
YOU
LL
MOST
CERTAINLY
BE
IN
DANGER
WHEN
HELD
IT
IN
BOTH
HANDS
-
LOOKING
AT
ME
THOUGHTFULLY
OVER
THE
TOP
OF
IT
-
-
NO
-
-
HE
SAID
AT
LAST
-
-
I
CANT
ALLOW
-
-
IT
-
-
-
YOU
CANT
VERY
WELL
STOP
ME
-
-
-
I
CAN
DO
BETTER
THAN
THAT
-
IF
WE
WERE
TO
GET
MARRIED
NOW
I
COULD
COME
WITH
YOU
-
-
I
LOOKED
DOWN
AT
MY
PLATE
-
NOT
DARING
TO
LET
HIM
SEE
HOW
MUCH
THE
IDEA
APPEALED
TO
ME
-
REMINDING
MYSELF
THAT
HE
COULD
ONLY
HAVE
SAID
SUCH
A
THING
BECAUSE
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW
THE
WHOLE
TRUTH
-
-
DEADLOCK
-
-
SAID
MAX
-
-
NO
-
IT
ISNT
-
WHATEVER
YOU
SAY
-
-
-
I
WAS
AFRAID
OF
THAT
-
-
HE
SOUNDED
RESIGNED
BUT
NONE
THE
LESS
HOPEFUL
-
-
YOU
RE
A
VERY
WILFUL
WOMAN
BUT
I
LL
CHANGE
YOUR
MIND
FOR
YOU
ONE
OF
THESE
DAYS
-
IF
YOU
CAN
GET
TO
BLETCHAM
THIS
EVENING
I
LL
RUN
YOU
UP
THERE
YOU
-
-
-
NICE
-
NOTHING
-
I
TOLD
YOU
-
I
M
MAD
ABOUT
BOATS
-
SEVEN
I
COULD
NOT
ENDURE
THE
THOUGHT
OF
ANOTHER
WAIT
AT
THE
BUS
STATION
-
HE
WAS
THERE
PUNCTUALLY
-
DRESSED
IN
A
LOUD
TARTAN
SHIRT
AND
ABBREVIATED
SHORTS
HE
LOOKED
HARDLY
MORE
THAN
A
BOY
-
A
CHEERFUL
-
GOODNATURED
BOY
-
HE
SETTLED
ME
INTO
THE
CAR
WITH
TOUCHING
CARE
AND
THEN
DROVE
LIKE
A
FIEND
ALONG
THE
RIVER
ROAD
-
TEN
MINUTES
LATER
HE
STOPPED
IN
A
LANE
AND
HELPED
ME
OUT
WITH
THE
SAME
I
ASKED
-
-
SHE
-
-
HE
CORRECTED
-
-
SHE
S
A
CONVERTED
LIFEBOAT
-
NOT
A
VERY
GOOD
ONE
-
BUT
SHE
S
SOUND
ENOUGH
AND
THE
ENGINE
S
FINE
-
-
INSIDE
-
SHE
WAS
UNTIDY
AND
GRUBBY
BUT
ROOMY
ENOUGH
AND
WELL
LIT
BY
TWO
ROWS
OF
GOODSIZED
WINDOWS
-
IT
WAS
A
LONG
TIME
BEFORE
I
GOT
USED
TO
CALLING
THEM
PORTHOLES
-
THE
OWNER
WAS
A
MIDDLEAGED
MAN
WHOSE
FAMILY
HAD
TIRED
OF
THE
LIMITED
EXCITEMENT
OF
THE
RIVER
AND
NOW
HAD
THEIR
EYES
ON
A
SEAGOING
BOAT
-
CLIVE
-
HE
INSISTED
ON
BEING
CALLED
CLIVE
-
HAGGLED
WITH
HIM
AND
WITHIN
HALF
AN
HOUR
SANDPIPER
WAS
MINE
FOR
THREE
HUNDRED
AND
FIFTY
POUNDS
-
WHEN
ALL
THE
BUSINESS
DETAILS
HAD
BEEN
SETTLED
AND
THE
OWNER
HAD
DEPARTED
WITH
MY
CHEQUE
IN
HIS
POCKET
-
CLIVE
STARTED
THE
ENGINE
AND
GAVE
ME
MY
FIRST
LESSON
IN
MANOEUVRING
UP
AND
DOWN
IT
WAS
A
WARM
-
STILL
EVENING
-
THE
PLOP
OF
FISH
AND
THE
GENTLE
PUTTER
OF
THE
ENGINE
WERE
INFINITELY
SOOTHING
AFTER
CITY
NOISES
-
AND
I
BEGAN
TO
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
MY
LIFE
ON
THE
WATER
-
AT
LAST
HE
PRONOUNCED
ME
RIVERWORTHY
AND
WANTED
TO
KNOW
WHEN
I
WOULD
BE
MOVING
IN
-
LIKE
CLIVE
-
HE
WAS
ENTHUSIASTIC
ABOUT
THE
ENGINE
AND
DECIDED
-
APPARENTLY
ON
THE
STRENGTH
OF
ITS
EFFICIENCY
-
THAT
SANDPIPER
WAS
FIT
TO
LIVE
IN
-
I
WAS
MORE
THAN
THANKFUL
FOR
HIS
HELP
WHEN
WE
HAD
INSTALLED
MY
THINGS
AND
THE
BOAT
BEGAN
TO
MOVE
-
THE
RIVER
WAS
CROWDED
WITH
FLOCKS
OF
SAILING
BOATS
WHICH
SWIRLED
ROUND
US
LIKE
GULLS
AND
THERE
WERE
TWO
LOCKS
TO
NEGOTIATE
-
BUT
MAX
SEEMED
TO
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHAT
TO
DO
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
KEPT
ME
SUPPLIED
HIM
-
I
USED
TO
PLAY
ABOUT
IN
THESE
THINGS
WHEN
I
WAS
A
KID
-
AND
THEN
I
ACTED
AS
GUIDE
GOING
BETWEEN
TERMS
AT
COLLEGE
-
IT
WAS
THE
FIRST
I
HAD
HEARD
OF
IT
-
BUT
THAT
S
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
I
LIKE
ABOUT
MAX
-
HE
HAS
DONE
SO
MANY
THINGS
THAT
THERE
IS
ALWAYS
SOMETHING
NEW
AND
EXCITING
TO
SAID
-
MEANING
IT
-
HE
PRESSED
THE
TIP
OF
MY
NOSE
WITH
ONE
FINGER
-
THAT
MAKES
TWO
OF
US
-
IT
WAS
ABOUT
EIGHT
OCLOCK
IN
THE
EVENING
WHEN
WE
TIED
UP
ALMOST
EXACTLY
OPPOSITE
HARDYS
GARDEN
AND
WENT
UP
ON
TO
THE
IT
STOOD
A
LONG
WAY
BACK
FROM
THE
WATER
AT
THE
END
OF
A
VELVETY
LAWN
FLANKED
WITH
FLOWERING
TREES
AND
SHRUBS
-
TO
THE
RIGHT
OF
ANCIENT
BOATHOUSE
SHROUDED
IN
WISTARIA
-
IT
WAS
BUILT
ACROSS
A
NARROW
BACKWATER
AND
THERE
WAS
A
DELICATE
IRON
STAIRCASE
CLIMBING
THE
OUTER
WALL
TO
A
ROOM
ABOVE
-
HAND
TO
STOP
HIM
-
THE
SUN
WAS
NO
LONGER
SHINING
AND
IT
WAS
DARK
ACROSS
THERE
BY
THE
TREES
-
BUT
I
THOUGHT
I
HAD
SEEN
SOMETHING
MOVE
-
THROUGH
HIM
-
AND
HIS
MIND
SEEMED
TO
MELT
AWAY
INTO
EMPTINESS
-
HIS
BULGING
EYES
CAUGHT
THE
RECLINING
FORM
OF
HEATHER
-
WHO
WAS
STILL
REPEATING
IN
SINGSONG
-
-
-
I
WILL
NOT
GIVE
IN
-
-
HE
STARED
AT
HER
OF
HALF
WORDS
-
HE
SLAPPED
HIMSELF
IN
THE
FACE
AND
CUFFED
THE
SIDES
OF
HIS
HEAD
-
THEN
BY
DEGREES
THE
ROTATING
OBJECTS
SLOWED
-
AND
COMING
INTO
FOCUS
TOOK
THE
FORM
OF
THE
FURNISHINGS
IN
DAN
BROWNS
LIVING
ROOM
-
HE
STOOD
UP
UN
STEADILY
AND
LOOKED
ABOUT
THE
ROOM
-
TRYING
TO
GATHER
HIS
WITS
-
OUTSIDE
THE
DUSK
WAS
SETTLING
OVER
DOWS
LAKE
AND
SILHOUETTE
-
ALREADY
A
SOLID
BLACK
-
SWITCHED
IT
ON
-
HEATHER
MCNABB
STILL
LAY
ON
THE
COUCH
-
HER
BODY
UNCOMFORTABLY
TWISTED
AND
AFFLICTED
WITH
OCCASIONAL
SPASMODIC
JERKS
-
HE
WENT
TO
THE
KITCHEN
FOR
WATER
AND
FOUND
DAN
-
DAN
WAS
LYING
ON
A
LONG
BENCH
IN
THE
BREAKFAST
NOOK
-
HIS
HEAD
BENT
UPRIGHT
AGAINST
THE
WALL
-
HIS
USUALLY
ANIMATED
FACE
WAS
EXPRESSIONLESS
AND
LOOKED
FLAT
-
AS
THOUGH
HIS
NOSE
HAD
BEEN
PUSHED
BACK
AND
HIS
EYES
AND
CHEEKS
BROUGHT
FORWARD
-
HE
MOUTHED
A
LOW
MUTTER
-
PUNCTUATED
AT
INTERVALS
WITH
A
FEW
SYLLABLES
OF
A
CRAZY
AND
INCOHERENT
JARGON
-
AS
STEVE
LOOKED
AT
HIM
HIS
MOUTH
SUDDENLY
SNAPPED
SHUT
-
WITH
JAWS
ASKEW
-
THERE
WAS
UTTER
IMBECILITY
IN
HIS
BLANK
FACE
-
PRESENTLY
THE
MUTTERING
STARTED
AGAIN
-
AND
WENT
ON
AND
ON
-
STUNNED
AND
SHAKEN
-
STEVE
DREW
A
GLASS
OF
WATER
AND
WENT
BACK
TO
HEATHER
-
HALF
AN
HOUR
LATER
HEATHER
AND
STEVE
WERE
STILL
TRYING
TO
SHAKEOFF
THE
LAST
TRACES
OF
HYPNOTIC
AFTEREFFECTS
-
FOR
SEVERAL
MINUTES
THEY
HAD
BEEN
FACING
EACH
OTHER
ACROSS
A
LOW
TABLE
-
LIKE
TWO
OLD
CONVALESCENTS
THOROUGHLY
BORED
WITH
EACH
OTHER
THROUGH
FORCED
ASSOCIATION
-
THEN
SOMETHING
LIKE
A
ZEST
FOR
LIVING
BEGAN
TO
COME
BACK
TO
STEVE
AND
HE
SQUEEZED
HER
HAND
-
HER
FACE
TOOK
ON
ENOUGH
ANIMATION
TO
PRODUCE
A
WAN
SMILE
-
DANS
LOW
MUT
TERING
WAS
JUST
AUDIBLE
FROM
THE
KITCHEN
-
AND
STEVE
COULD
SEE
THAT
AS
HEATHER
RECOVERED
HER
SENSES
AND
EMOTIONS
SHE
WAS
GROWING
COLD
AND
NUMB
WITH
SHOCK
-
SHE
HAD
SEEN
DAN
-
OR
RATHER
THE
PHYSICAL
RELIC
OF
HIM
-
THE
EMPTY
SHELL
OF
FLESH
AND
BONE
-
DEVOID
OF
INTELLECT
AND
AND
THESE
HAD
BEEN
HIS
GREAT
QUALITIES
-
SO
ATTRACTIVE
TO
HER
-
THE
BASE
STATION
HAD
GONE
BEFORE
-
DISCHARGING
ITS
NARROW
PLANE
OF
4EMENTALATING
ENERGY
ALONG
THE
LENGTH
OF
THE
EARTHS
IMAGINARY
LONGITUDES
-
MOVING
REVERSED
PROGRESSION
-
IT
HAD
BROUGHT
THE
FIRST
STAGE
IN
THE
THETAN
PATTERN
OF
CONQUEST
-
THE
EMPTYMINDED
RECEPTIVENESS
THAT
PREPARED
THE
WAY
FOR
THE
SECOND
STAGE
-
HE
ROSE
FROM
HIS
BREAKFASTNOOK
BENCH
AND
CAME
INTO
THE
LIVINGROOM
-
WHERE
HEATHER
AND
STEVE
STOOD
AGHAST
AT
HIS
ENTRANCE
-
HE
CAME
-
ALMOST
FALLING
FORWARD
IN
AN
UNGAINLY
SHUFFLE
-
NECK
THRUST
OUT
-
ARMS
DANGLING
LOOSELY
-
THEN
-
ABRUPTLY
-
HE
DREW
HIMSELF
UP
AND
WALKED
ON
THE
VERY
TIPS
OF
HIS
TOES
-
HE
STRETCHED
HIS
ARMS
DRAWINGIN
GREAT
BREATHS
THAT
FORWARD
-
-
ISNT
IT
A
GLORIOUS
THING
-
LONG
AWAITED
TRANSCENDENT
EVENT
-
THE
EXALTED
DESIRE
OF
ALL
MANKIND
THROUGH
ALL
AGES
-
THE
KINGDOM
OF
THE
MIND
IS
AT
HAND
-
-
HE
TURNED
BEAMING
EYES
UPWARD
AND
SHOOK
HIS
HEAD
SLOWLY
FROM
SIDE
TO
SIDE
-
A
SUPERFLUOUS
PRECAUTION
FOR
THERE
WAS
NO
OTHER
CAR
ABROAD
-
AND
NO
PEDESTRIAN
TO
CROSS
HIS
PATH
NOR
TO
WAIT
AT
AN
INTERSECTION
FOR
THE
LIGHT
TO
CHANGE
-
AT
HIS
APARTMENT
HE
GARAGED
HIS
CAR
AND
THEN
STOOD
LOSES
ITS
BEAT
IN
DEATH
-
DEADLY
STILLNESS
-
DEADLY
PORTENT
-
STEVE
AWAKENED
EARLY
AND
SWITCHED
ON
THE
SET
LIGHTEDUP
BUT
GAVE
ONLY
A
LOW
BUZZING
SOUND
-
HE
HAD
JUST
FINISHED
SHAVING
WHEN
IT
CAME
ON
-
WITH
A
FLAT
VOICE
REPEATING
-
-
THIS
IS
BBC
CALLING
-
THIS
IS
BBC
CALLING
-
-
AFTER
WHAT
SEEMED
AN
UNDUE
PERIOD
OF
REPETITION
-
THE
VOICE
WENT
ON
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
LANDING
OF
THE
THETAN
COLONY
IN
SUSSEX
-
IN
ALL
ITS
OBSCENE
DETAILS
-
THEN
THE
RADIO
WENT
DEAD
AGAIN
-
AND
STEVE
HAD
NO
STOMACH
FOR
BREAKFAST
-
IT
WAS
A
BEAUTIFUL
DAY
-
AS
FIRSTSOFJUNE
SHOULD
BE
-
STEVE
GOT
OUT
THE
CAR
AND
TRAVERSED
THE
SAME
EMPTY
STREETS
AS
HE
HAD
THE
NIGHT
BEFORE
-
TO
KEEP
AN
APPOINTMENT
WITH
HEATHER
-
COMING
AROUND
THE
GREAT
MASS
OF
THE
CHATEAU
LAURIER
-
HE
BRAKED
TO
A
SCREECHING
STOP
-
A
FLYING
SAUCER
WAS
TILTING
AND
DIPPING
OVER
THE
WAR
MEMORIAL
-
THERE
WAS
A
DEEP
OVERTONE
THAT
SANG
IN
HIS
EARS
WITH
AN
ALMOST
PAINFUL
SHARPNESS
-
HE
REVERSED
AND
TURNED
BACK
ON
MCKENZIE
AVENUE
-
THE
THETANS
MUST
NOT
SEE
HIM
-
HE
TOOK
ANOTHER
ROUTE
TO
HEATHERS
AND
SAW
TWO
MORE
FLYING
SAUCERS
ON
THE
WAY
-
HEATHER
WAS
VERY
ANXIOUS
TO
VISIT
DAN
AT
ONCE
-
BUT
STEVE
INSISTED
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
FIRST
DISCUSS
THEIR
SITUATION
-
AS
FAR
AS
IT
COULD
BE
ASSESSED
-
AND
TO
DECIDE
ON
WHAT
SEEMED
TO
BE
THE
BEST
WAY
OF
MEETING
IT
-
-
THE
THETANS
-
-
HE
SAID
-
-
ARE
PRESUMABLY
HERE
TO
TAKE
CHARGE
-
AS
IT
WERE
-
OF
THE
MINDS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
-
WHO
ARE
PROBABLY
FALLING
ALL
OVER
THEM
SELVES
IN
THEIR
ZEAL
TO
GET
THEIR
ORDERS
AND
TO
CARRY
THEM
OUT
-
JUST
WHAT
THESE
ORDERS
WILL
BE
-
WE
DONT
KNOW
-
NOW
-
BECAUSE
OF
PRIOR
HYPNOSIS
WE
HAVE
ES
CAPED
THETAN
SUBJUGATION
-
THIS
TIME
-
BUT
WE
NO
LONGER
HAVE
ANY
IMMUNITY
-
THERE
CAN
BE
LITTLE
DOUBT
THAT
IF
THE
THETANS
DISCOVER
OUR
MENTAL
INDEPENDENCE
THEY
WILL
PROMPTLY
GIVE
US
THEIR
HYPNOTIC
TREATMENT
-
IF
WE
CAN
AVOID
UNDUE
PROMINENCE
-
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
WE
CAN
MOVE
ABOUT
PRETTY
FREELY
WITHOUT
DETECTION
-
IF
WE
CAN
-
WELL
-
THEN
WE
INTERESTS
-
WHAT
THOSE
INTERESTS
ARE
-
BEYOND
PERSONAL
SECURITY
-
I
HAVENT
A
CLUE
-
BUT
-
WHO
KNOWS
-
-
NOW
-
TO
SUMMARIZE
WHAT
I
THINK
OUR
COURSE
OF
ACTION
SHOULD
BE
-
FIRST
-
TO
AVOID
THE
THETANS
LIKE
THE
PLAGUE
-
FOR
THEY
MUST
NOT
FIND
US
OUT
-
SECOND
-
TO
TREAD
PRETTY
WARILY
AMONG
OUR
OWN
PEOPLE
-
FINDING
OUT
JUST
HOW
MUCH
FREEDOM
WE
CAN
TAKE
WITH
SAFETY
-
AND
THIRD
-
TO
STUDY
THESE
DAMNED
THETANS
-
WE
MUST
LEARN
ALL
WE
CAN
ABOUT
THEM
-
THERE
IS
JUST
A
HOPE
THAT
WE
MAY
UNCOVER
SOME
WEAKNESS
-
AND
FIND
A
WAY
OF
FIGHTING
BACK
AT
THEM
-
-
HEATHER
AGREED
-
AND
SUGGESTED
THAT
THEY
USE
DAN
AS
A
SPECIMEN
DEMONSTRA
TING
HOW
THE
THETAN
MACHINATIONS
HAD
BEEN
WORKING
OUT
-
IT
OCCURRED
TO
STEVE
THAT
THIS
MAY
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
ENTIRELY
AN
OBJECTIVE
SUGGESTION
ON
HER
PART
-
BUT
HE
THOUGHT
IT
A
GOOD
IDEA
SO
THEY
PROCEEDED
TO
SEE
IF
THE
COAST
WAS
CLEAR
-
THE
STREET
WAS
QUIET
AND
NOR
SOUND
OF
FLYING
SAUCERS
-
SO
THEY
VENTURED
FORTH
AND
MADE
THEIR
WAY
ON
FOOT
TO
DANS
HOUSE
-
DAN
CAME
TO
THE
DOOR
AT
THEIR
RING
BUT
NEGLECTED
TO
OFFER
ANY
GREETING
-
HE
WAS
DEEPLY
PREOCCUPIED
-
AND
IT
SEEMED
THAT
THE
RINGING
OF
A
DOORBELL
WAS
TO
HIM
A
NEW
AND
STRANGE
PHENOMENON
-
WHEN
HE
FINALLY
BECKONED
TO
THEM
TO
ENTER
-
THE
ACTION
GAVE
THE
IMPRESSION
OF
HAVING
BEEN
THOUGHT
OUT
AND
THEIR
HEADS
LIKE
TENNIS
SPECTATORS
AS
HE
WALKED
UP
AND
DOWN
-
UP
AND
DOWN
-
HIS
WHOLE
ATTITUDE
WAS
A
MIXTURE
OF
IMPATIENCE
PENDING
AN
AWAITED
COMMUNICATION
AND
OF
A
VAGUE
PERPLEXITY
RESPECTING
HIS
SURROUNDINGS
AND
THE
PURPOSE
HE
WAS
TO
SERVE
-
HEATHER
AND
STEVE
TRIED
TO
MAKE
THEMSELVES
AT
HOME
-
STEVE
SWITCHED
ON
DANS
POWERFUL
-
WORLDWIDE
RADIO
AND
SYSTEMATICALLY
TURNED
THE
TUNING
KNOB
THROUGH
ALL
THE
THEY
FOLLOWED
HIM
TO
A
CITY
BUS
STOP
ON
CARLING
AVENUE
-
WHERE
HE
WAITED
-
THE
BUS
STOP
WAS
A
DESERTED
ISLAND
ON
AN
EMPTY
STREET
-
BUT
NOT
FOR
LONG
-
FOR
SOON
PEDESTRIANS
AND
CARS
FLOCKED
UPON
THE
AVENUE
FROM
ITS
MANY
TRIBUTARY
STREETS
-
IT
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
A
NORMAL
BUSINESSDAY
BUSTLE
-
EXCEPT
FOR
TWO
ANOMALIES
-
WALKED
-
OR
DROVE
-
OR
WAITED
AS
A
PERSON
POSSESSED
OF
A
SINGLE
ALLEXCLUSIVE
PURPOSE
-
AFTER
A
LONG
WAIT
A
BUS
APPEARED
AND
THEY
FOLLOWED
THE
BEAMING
DAN
ABOARD
-
TAKING
SEATS
SOME
ROWS
BEHIND
HIM
-
STEVE
WAS
BEGINNING
TO
FIND
THE
STEREOTYPED
-
FLATTISH
-
HAPPY
FACES
VERY
DISCONCERTING
-
AND
LOOKING
AT
HEATHER
HE
FOUND
A
WELCOME
RELIEF
IN
HER
RELATIVELY
LONG
DOLEFUL
ONE
THEN
HE
WOULD
GO
BACK
TO
PLATO
FOR
A
FINAL
SPELL
OF
REAL
DAYS
AND
WOULD
RETURN
TO
NEW
YORK
IN
LATE
LITTLE
SORRY
IF
WE
WERE
NOT
BACK
FOR
CHRISTMAS
AS
ARRANGED
-
BUT
HE
CONSOLED
HIMSELF
BY
THINKING
THAT
HE
AND
ANGELINA
WOULD
HAVE
PLENTY
OF
TIME
TOGETHER
IN
THE
FUTURE
-
AND
HEAVEN
ALONE
KNEW
WHEN
-
IF
EVER
-
HE
WOULD
BE
BACK
ON
MOON
AGAIN
-
AND
ABLE
TO
DO
RESEARCH
AT
FIRST
HAND
INTO
MATTERS
ON
WHICH
THE
FUTURE
OF
EVERYONE
-
INCLUDING
ANGELINA
-
DEPENDED
-
EXPENSES
-
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
TO
WHOM
MOKE
HAD
SENT
HIM
-
LITTLE
PEOPLE
WHO
REGARDED
HIM
AS
LUCKY
TO
HAVE
DESCENDED
FROM
SUCH
ECONOMIC
ALTITUDES
-
TOM
DREYFUS
HAD
A
JOB
ON
THE

IN
THE
SECRETARIAT
-
STAMP
DEPARTMENT
-
WHILE
SALLY
SULKED
AT

-
THEY
HAD
BEEN

FOR

BUT
THE

-
ON
THE
EXPECTATION
OF
WHICH
THEY
HAD
DONE
SO
-
HAD
NOT

-
DO
YOU

I
HAD
TO
SEND
BACK
OUR

IN
THE
SECOND
YEAR

SHE
HAD

IN

A

A

A
FACT
HE
ACCEPTED
AS
INEVITABLE

I
GUESS
SALLY
MADE
A
MISTAKE
ABOUT
ME
-
-
HE
SAID
ONE
EVENING
-
WHEN
HE
HAD
BEEN
LEFT
TO
COOK
HIS

-
WAS
A
STATIC
MIB
-
THE
MIDDLEINCOMEBRACKET
EQUIVALENT
TO
4SUBLIL
ON
THE

-
ALL
ARISTOTLE
WAS
EXCITED
AT
THE
TIME
-
NOT
BY
THE
PROSPECT
OF
THE
US
PRESIDENTS
VISIT
-
BUT
BY
A
GREAT
STORM
IN
THE
PHOTO
SPHERE
OF
THE
SUN
-
A
MATTER
WHICH
ON
EARTH
WOULD
HARDLY
PENETRATE
BEYOND
THE
MINDS
OF
ASTRONOMERS
WAS
OF
GENERAL
ONE
WONDERED
IF
THIS
GREATER
AWARENESS
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
COSMOS
MIGHT
WITH
TIME
INSTIL
THE
REVERENCE
WHICH
-
ON
EARTH
-
NATURE
INSPIRES
-
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
ONE
REFLECTED
THAT
THE
ROCKETS
OVER
WHICH
MR
PERONS
BOARD
PRESIDED
HAD
IT
IN
THEIR
POWER
PERMANENTLY
TO
WARP
THE
SOLAR
SYSTEM
-
TRUE
ENOUGH
-
SUCH
ULTIMATE
WEAPONS
HAD
NOT
BEEN
ALLIES
BEING
MORE
INFERIOR
THAN
FORMERLY
TO
WCU
IN
THE
LESTER
WAS
NOT
HOME
YET
FROM
HIS
FORMIDABLE
DUTIES
AND
HIS
WIFE
-
IN
THE
MANNER
OF
MIDDLEBROW
COUNTRY
LAWYER
-
AND
WE
WERE
VERY
SMALL
4MICRODEBS
-
WERENT
WE
-
SALLY
-
-
HERE
SHE
HAD
DROPPED
HER
VOICE
IN
HOMAGE
TO
THE
ECONOMIC
SYSTEM
-
THAT
WAS
REVERENCED
-
-
WHEN
HE
THOUGHT
WE
MIGHT
GET
GO
A
BIT
BETTER
IF
HE
ENTERED
POLITICS
-
KNOW
HOW
HE
DID
IT
-
HE
S
CLEVER
ON
THE
MOUTHORGAN
-
SO
WHEN
HE
VISITED
SOME
CRATERLET
ON
FACE
-
OURS
IS
AN
AGRICULTURAL
AS
SOON
AS
HE
HAD
SPOKEN
A
FEW
SENTENCES
OF
HIS
SPEECH
-
-
CUT
THE

-
LESTER
-
GIVE
US
SOMETHING
ON
YOUR

WE
CAME
THROUGH
TO
4MAKRODEB

AND
GOT
ALL
THESE
LOVELY
THINGS
-
-
SHE
WAVED
A
PLUMP
HAND
TOWARDS
HER
GRAND
PIANOS
-
ETC
-
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
A
DOOR
BANGED
-
-
BUT
DONT
SAY
A
WORD
ABOUT
IT
-
LESTER
WANTS
HIS
MOUTHORGAN
TO
BE
FORGOTTEN
NOW
-
THE
TIME
HAS
COME
FOR
HIM
TO
BE
TAKEN
SERIOUSLY
AS
A
STATESMAN
-
-
PERON
ENTERED
-
A
LARGE
MAN
-
WHO
HAD
ONCE
BEEN
HANDSOME
BUT
WAS
NOW
SEEDYLOOKING
-
A
SUFFERER
FROM
STOMACHULCERS
-
IN
THE
BACKFACE
TRADITION
HE
WORE
-
AND
KEPT
ON
INDOORS
-
A
FIFTY
GALLON
HAT
-
HARRY
WAS
PREPARED
FOR
SOMETHING
UNPLEASANT
-
FOR
THIS
WAS
THE
SENATOR
WHO
HAD
ANNOYED
THE
UNITED
STATES
BY
BRAGGING
HOW
HE
HAD
ONCE
WON
A
TRICK
FROM
WCU
BY
THREATENING
TO
LOOSE
OFF
ONE
OF
HIS
ROCKETS
-
AN
ADMISSION
WHICH
WOULD
SCARCELY
HELP
BLUFF
TO
SUCCEED
THE
NEXT
TIME
-
AND
-
LATELY
-
BY
BUT
PRIVATELY
HE
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
AS
FRIENDLY
AS
MR
WISE
THE
TUBE
MANUFACTURER
-
TO
HAVE
THE
SAME
ADOLESCENT
OPENNESS
AND
FRESHNESS
-
THOUGH
PERHAPS
NOT
THE
SAME
MATURITY
-
ONE
REMEMBERED
THAT
HE
WAS
A
LAWYER
BY
TRAINING
-
AND
SUSPECTED
THAT
THE
POINTS
HE
MADE
SO
SHARPLY
IN
INTERNATIONAL
POLITICS
WERE
AS
ABSTRACT
TO
HIM
AS
THOSE
A
LAWYER
MAKES
IN
A
COURT
OF
LAW
-
THE
MOTIVE
WOULD
BE
THE
SAME
IN
BOTH
CASES
-
TO
SERVE
THIS
HOME
OF
HIS
-
IN
WHICH
HIS
HEART
LAY
-
HERE
THE
ROCKET
MANS
CHARM
WAS
DISARMING
-
YET
WHEN
THE
TIME
CAME
TO
LEAVE
-
HARRY
FELT
AS
DE
PRESSED
AS
WHEN
HE
LEFT
MRS
HALLIDAYS
OFFICE
-
EXACTLY
A
MONTH
AGO
-
IF
EVEN
MO
STATESMEN
ONLY
DID
WHAT
THEY
HAD
TO
DO
TO
GET
GO
ON
AN
EXPAN
DING
SCALE
-
AND
LEFT
THE
SUMTOTAL
OF
THEIR
ACTIONS
-
AND
THEIR
LUNAR
AND
EARTHLY
REPERCUSSIONS
-
TO
LUCK
THE
POLITICAL
LIFE
OF
ARISTOTLE
LOOKED
MORE
AND
MORE
LIKE
A
MASQUERADE
OF
BUSINESS
INTERESTS
IN
DIS
GUISE
WHICH
-
FAR
FROM
ATTRACTING
THE
ALLEGIANCE
OF
FREE
MEN
EVERYWHERE
-
COULD
ONLY
REPEL
THEM
-
THEN
WHAT
OF
THE
CULTURAL
LIFE
-
DID
THIS
PER
HAPS
NURTURE
A
GENUINELY
CIVILIZING
IMPULSE
WHICH
MIGHT
IN
TIME
BECOME
SOCIAL
FACT
AND
COUNTERACT
THE
OBSESSION
WITH
ECONOMICS
WHICH
HAD
GROWN
UP
DURING
THE
MOONS
FIRST
TWO
CENTURIES
-
AT
THE
CENTRE
OF
EACH
CIRCLE
STOOD
PERSONNEL
AND
THEIR
FILING
CLERKS
-
THE
STUDENTS
HAD
WERE
NOW
BEING
BOUGHT
FORWARD
IN
THEIR

-
BY
COMPARING
PERSONAL
APPEARANCES
WITH
UNIVERSITY
RECORDS
-
THE
AGENTS
OF
THE
AND
WOMEN
WHO
INTERESTED
THEM
-
AND
CONTRACTS
WOULD
BE
INITIALLED
AT
THE

SINCE
STARTING

WOULD
DEPEND
ON

A

B
IN
THE
FINALS
NEXT

-
AND
SINCE
MATING

WOULD
DEPEND
UPON
SALARIES
-
SCHOLARSHIP
FOR
THESE
FINE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WAS
CLOSELY
GEARED
TO
WERE
REALLY
MEANS
-
SO
-
SEEING
THEM
REVOLVE
IN
MOKE
CONSCIOUSLY
OR
UNCONSCIOUSLY
SYMBOLISED
-
ANY
WAY
IN
HARRYS
MIND
-
HAD
THESE
SPLENDID
YOUNG
PEOPLE
BY
THE
SHORT
HAIRS
-
AND
WAS
DIVERTING
THEM
-
TO
BE
DIVERTED
-
HOWEVER
-
WITH
THE
SINGLE
EXCEPTION
OF
ONE
STEP
-
HE
LOOKED
AS
IF
NOTHING
MOKE
AND
HIS
NEUROSIS
AND
NOT
IN
SOME
ERUPTION
FROM
THOSE
TRANSECONOMIC
-
SO
ONCE
AGAIN
THE
METAPHYSICS
WERE
DEPRESSING
-
AND
IN
ABSOLUTE
CONTRAST
TO
THE
PHYSICAL
DISPLAY
-
MOS
HAVE
AN
UNAMERICAN
LOVE
OF
PARADES
-
AND
THESE
YOUNG
ONES
-
ON
PARADE
FOR
JOBS
WHICH
THEY
PUTTING
THEIR
BEST
FOOT
FORWARD
-
EDGE
-
DID
YOU
NOTICE
-
AND
THE
MULES
DIDNT
SEEM
TO
WANT
TO
GET
OFF
THE

-
-
HE
PEERED
AS
IT
WERE
INTO
THE
DARK
SECRETS
NIGHT
-
EXCEPTIONALLY
BRILLIANT
AND
STRANGE
-
FOR
IN
THE
PROXIMITY
OF
THE

-
WHOSE
PRESENCE
I
COULD
ALMOST
SMELL
-
ON
THE
COSMIC
HANDIWORK
-
-
ALL
THOSE
STARS
-
BUT
I
M
A
BIT
EARTHBOUND
TONIGHT
-
TROUT
-
I
VE
GOT
A
QUEER
FEELING
-
LIKE
I
ALWAYS
GET
WHEN
SOMETHING
IF
YOU
ASK
ME
-
MIGHT
BE
JAGUAR
-
MIGHT
BE
-
HOPE
I
DIE
KIND
OF
COMPOSED
-
TROUT
-
I
MEAN
YOU
CANT
IMAGINE
THE
CHRISTIAN
MARTYRS
TWISTING
AND
SHRIEKING
-
LION
MUNCHING
-
OR
ARROWS
WHERE
IT
HURTS
MOST
-
OR
CAN
YOU
-
LOOK
OVER
THERE
-
-
HE
POINTED
TO
THE
SHADOWS
BEYOND
THE
RIVER
-
-
SOMETHING
MOVED
-
-
MAY
HAVE
THOUGHT
I
HAD
BECOME
UNBALANCED
THROUGH
FEAR
-
-
A
CHARACTER
MR
GILBERTO
MENTIONED
THE
FOREST
INDIANS
ARE
SAID
TO
BE
MORTALLY
AFRAID
-
WITH
A
HOOF
SHAPED
LIKE
THE
HEEL
OF
A
BOTTLE
-
IF
YOUR
LORDSHIP
WILL
EXCUSE
ME
A
MOMENT
-
-
SMALL
-
REPULSIVE
CREATURES
THEY
WERE
-
RESEMBLANCE
TO
THE
SHRUNK
HEADS
WE
HAD
GAZED
AT
RECENTLY
-
AND
I
HAVE
NO
HESITATION
IN
SAYING
THAT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
AN
END
OF
US
BUT
FOR
AN
INTERVENTION
SO
UNEXPECTED
-
SO
UNUSUAL
-
THAT
ONLY
THE
NECESSITY
OF
ROUNDING
MY
NARRATIVE
COMPELS
ME
TO
MENTION
IT
-
I
HAD
A
DISTINCT
IMPRESSION
THAT
THE
HUT
HAD
RECENTLY
BEEN
CLEANED
AND
PREPARED
FOR
VISITORS
-
MRS
CAINE
SAID
WE
WERE
TO
GO
NO
FURTHER
UNLESS
AND
UNTIL
WE
WERE
SENT
FOR
-
CONFIRMING
ANOTHER
IMPRESSION
THAT
BECAME
MORE
AND
MORE
DEFINITE
-
NAMELY
-
THAT
SHE
WAS
IN
TOUCH
WITH
AN
INVI
SIBLE
SOURCE
OF
AUTHORITY
-
SALLY
AND
OF
COURSE
MRS
SEPTIMUS
-
FOR
SURELY
MR
SEPTIMUS
STOOD
IN
THE
SAME
CASE
AS
MYSELF
-
BUT
WAS
IT
SO
-
I
ALLOWED
MYSELF
TO
ENTERTAIN
FOR
AN
INSTANT
THE
IDEA
-
THE
WOULD
BE
INOPPORTUNE
-
AND
WITH
THE
IDEA
CAME
TO
WATCH
MR
SEPTIMUS
MORE
CLOSELY
-
MRS
CAINE
TOO
AND
MR
GILBERTO
WHO
WOULD
-
BUT
ALL
THREE
WERE
TO
THE
CASUAL
OBSERVATION
I
PERMITTED
MYSELF
UNRUFFLED
-
MR
SEPTIMUS
RESERVED
AND
CERTAINLY
VERY
THOUGHTFUL
-
BUT
THAT
WAS
HIS
HABIT
-
INDEED
WE
WERE
ALL
INVADED
BY
A
MOST
TRANQUIL
MOOD
-
EVEN
THE
INDIAN
SERVANTS
RELAXED
-
KNOWING
-
SO
MR
GILBERTO
TOLD
US
-
THAT
THE
WILD
AND
SAVAGE
TRIBES
NEVER
APPROACHED
THIS
REGION
-
AT
ANY
RATE
THEY
REMAINED
WITH
US
-
PERHAPS
FOR
SUCH
PROTECTION
AS
OUR
PRESENCE
-
OR
MRS
BUT
AFTER
WHAT
MRS
CAINE
HAD
SAID
IT
WAS
NEVER
FAR
FROM
OUR
MINDS
THAT
AT
ANY
MOMENT
WE
WERE
TO
RECEIVE
A
SUMMONS
-
I
COULD
SEE
THAT
MR
SEPTIMUS
WAS
IMPATIENT
FOR
IT
-
THIS
AFTERNOON
-
THEN
-
WE
CLIMBED
A
PROMONTORY
-
A
MASS
OF
CLEAN
ROCK
CROWNED
WITH
TREES
AND
BUSHES
-
THAT
STOOD
WELL
OUT
OVER
THE
LAKE
-
NO
ONE
HAS
EVER
SATISFACTORILY
EXPLAINED
HOW
A
TOO
CAREFREE
-
AND
BECOMING
AIRBORNE
-
CAUGHT
BY
A
SUDDEN
GUST
OF
WIND
-
A
COMBINATION
OF
THE
TWO
-
NO
ONE
SEEMS
TO
KNOW

BUT
THE
FACT
REMAINS
THAT

ITSELF

HE
WAS
ENTRUSTING
NOT
ONLY
HIS
OWN
LIFE
-
BUT
GEOFFREYS
AS
WELL
-
TO
A
STRANGE
GIRL
WHOM
HE
HAD
NEVER
MET
AND
ON
WHOM
AFTER
NO
MORE
THAN
A
COUPLE
OF
TELEPHONE
CALLS
HE
WAS
IT
WAS
A
NOVEL
EXPERIENCE
-
ALASTAIR
WAS
QUITE
UNABLE
TO
EXPLAIN
WHY
HE
SHOULD
FEEL
SO
MUCH
CONFIDENCE
IN
HER
-
ONCE
AGAIN
SHE
CHECKED
BACK
HER
INSTRUCTIONS
-
IT
WAS
OBVIOUS
THAT
SHE
DID
NOT
FAIL
TO
APPRECIATE
THE
FAITH
WHICH
HE
WAS
PLACING
IN
HER
AND
WAS
PREPARED
TO
ACCEPT
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
-
EVENING
-
AND
I
SHALL
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
MEETING
YOU
BOTH
AT
MIDNIGHT
-
-
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
ARRANGING
A
SUPPER
PARTY
-
THEN
SHE
RANG
OFF
-
ALASTAIR
ADMITTED
THAT
NEVER
IN
A
NOT
ALTOGETHER
UNEVENTFUL
LIFE
HAD
HE
COME
ACROSS
A
GIRL
WHO
SOUNDED
SO
CHARMING
AND
APPEARED
TO
BE
SO
EFFICIENT
-
FOR
SOME
REASON
THE
ORDERLIES
HAD
FORGOTTEN
TO
SWITCH
ON
THE
LIGHTS
-
THERE
WAS
NO
COLOUR
-
PHYSICAL
FEATURES
WERE
DISTINGUISHABLE
SOLELY
BY
GRADATIONS
OF
SILVERY
GREYNESS
-
EVEN
THE
SNOW
CAPPED
SUMMIT
OF
MONT
BLANC
-
SEVEN
MILES
BELOW
-
WAS
NOT
RECOGNISABLE
AMONG
THE
HOST
OF
LOWER
PEAKS
-
THE
SCREEN
OF
THE
AIRTOAIR
RADAR
GLOWED
-
OCCASIONALLY
MINUTE
SPOTS
FLICKERED
ACROSS
ITS
SURFACE
-
BUT
THERE
WAS
IN
THE
EXCEPTIONAL
CLARITY
HE
WAS
EVEN
ABLE
TO
MAKE
A
DIRECT
COMPARISON
BETWEEN
THE
RADAR
IMAGE
AND
THE
GROUND
ITSELF
-
AHEAD
LAY
THE
PLAIN
OF
LOMBARDY
-
TO
THE
RIGHT
-
TURIN
-
TO
THE
LEFT
-
MILAN
-
THE
DIRECTIONAL
ANGLE
OF
THE
SCANNER
COULD
BE
ADJUSTED
TO
COVER
ANY
PARTICULAR
AREA
WITHIN
ITS
RANGE
-
GEOFFREY
GROUND
IMMEDIATELY
AHEAD
-
HE
WAS
ABLE
TO
PICK
OUT
TOWNS
-
UNRECOGNISABLE
TO
THE
NAKED
EYE
-
OBSCURED
BY
THE
GROUND
HAZE
WHICH
EVEN
ON
THE
CLEAREST
NIGHT
LIMITED
ANGULAR
VISION
-
HE
GLANCED
AT
THE
SPEED
RECORDER
-
IT
SEEMED
ALMOST
INCREDIBLE
THAT
THE
TINY
WHITE
FIGURE
OF
85
AGAINST
WHICH
THE
NEEDLE
WAS
RESTING
COULD
REALLY
MEAN
HUNDREDS
OF
KNOTS
-
NOW
-
AS
ALASTAIR
REDUCED
THE
THRUST
-
THE
PITCH
CHANGED
AS
THE
NOSE
OF
THE
AIRCRAFT
DIPPED
SLIGHTLY
-
THE
NEEDLE
OF
THE
SPEED
BEFORE
COMING
TO
REST
AT
50
-
-
WE
RE
A
BIT
SMILED
-
ALASTAIR
TALKED
OF
RUNNING
IN
WHEN
THEY
WERE
STILL
MORE
THAN
FOUR
HUNDRED
MILES
FROM
THEIR
DESTINATION
-
THEY
WERE
NEARING
MODENA
-
GEOFFREY
FOCUSED
THE
RADAR
SCANNER
BY
SPECIAL
HELICOPTER
FROM
THE
HORSE
GUARDS
GEOFFREY
SET
HIMSELF
TO
CONSIDER
THE
MOVEMENTS
OF
THE
BENTLEY
-
IT
HAD
PASSED
HIM
AT
THE
TEMPORARY
BRIDGE
OVER
THE
TARTARO
AT
A
FEW
MINUTES
PAST
TEN
ON
THE
PREVIOUS
NIGHT
-
HE
WORKED
OUT
THE
DISTANCE
ON
THE
PRESUMPTION
THAT
ITS
ROUTE
HAD
BEEN
THROUGH
FLORENCE
AND
ROME
AND
THEN
ACROSS
ITALY
VIA
FOGGIA
TO
BARLETTA
-
IT
CAME
TO
JUST
OVER
SIX
HUNDRED
MILES
-
DARKNESS
HAD
DESCENDED
LIKE
A
CURTAIN
BY
THE
TIME
THEY
DOCKED
AT
BELLERAY
-
AND
THOUGH
GUY
-
MADE
NERVOUS
BY
BERYLS
SILENCE
-
DROVE
AT
RECKLESS
SPEED
TO
THE
VILLA
-
IT
WAS
QUICKLY
EVIDENT
THAT
THE
PARTY
WAS
OVER
-
PIERS
CAME
STROLLING
OUT
TO
MEET
THE
DEANES
-
AND
AS
SOON
AS
GUY
HAD
DRIVEN
AWAY
-
INVITED
THEM
CASUALLY
TO
COME
TO
HIS
FLAT
FOR
A
DRINK
-
TO
BERYL
-
AT
LEAST
-
THIS
WAS
ANTICLIMAX
WITH
A
VENGEANCE
-
SHE
HAD
EXPECTED
TO
BE
MET
WITH
VIOLENT
REPROACHES
-
AND
HERE
HE
WAS
BLAND
AND
SMILING
-
BUT
IT
DID
NOT
TAKE
HER
LONG
TO
REALISE
THAT
HIS
MOOD
WAS
LESS
PLEASANT
THAN
APPEARED
ON
THE
SURFACE
-
HE
TOLD
HER
NONCHALANTLY
-
AS
HE
LED
THE
WAY
TO
HIS
OWN
VERANDA
-
THAT
HE
HAD
TAKEN
THE
LIBERTY
OF
ASKING
JACK
-
AS
A
REPRESENTATIVE
OF
THE
VALLIN
FAMILY
-
TO
COME
OVER
AND
MAKE
THE
PRESENTATION
IN
HER
STEAD
-
-
I
CAUGHT
HIM
JUST
AS
HE
WAS
GOING
TO
THE
OF
FACT
I
D
ASKED
HIM
LAST
NIGHT
TO
DEPUTISE
FOR
ME
AND
FETCH
HER
-
HE
BROUGHT
HER
TO
THE
PARTY
SAID
THE
FIRST
THING
THAT
CAME
INTO
HER
HEAD
-
CASUAL
TONE
-
-
SHE
S
NOT
RETURNING
TO
HER
FAMILY
-
SHE
S
GOING
TO
LIVE
WITH
FRIENDS
OF
THE
BANK
MANAGER
-
JUST
THIS
SIDE
OF
BELLERAY
-
-
MRS
DEANE
MADE
A
SUITABLE
COMMENT
-
BUT
BERYL
SAID
NOTHING
-
SHE
WAS
TRYING
TO
SORT
THINGS
OUT
IN
HER
MIND
-
THAT
BENEATH
HIS
UNNATURALLY
SMOOTH
EXTERIOR
PIERS
WAS
SIMMERING
WITH
ANGER
AGAINST
HER
SHE
HAD
NO
DOUBT
-
HAD
HAD
A
THOROUGHLY
GOOD
TIME
-
AND
IT
WOULD
TAKE
THEM
NEARLY
TO
NEXT
WEEK
TO
SETTLE
DOWN
AGAIN
-
MEANWHILE
HUBERT
WOULD
HAVE
BETAKEN
HIMSELF
AND
HIS
WELL
IT
WAS
ALL
OVER
AND
DONE
WITH
-
FOR
THE
TIME
BEING
BERYL
WAS
CONTENT
TO
LET
IT
GO
AT
THAT
-
BUT
SHE
RESOLVED
TO
HAVE
IT
OUT
WITH
PIERS
WHEN
A
REASONABLE
OPPORTUNITY
PRESENTED
ITSELF
-
HE
MUST
LEARN
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
TREAT
HER
WITH
INJUSTICE
AND
CONTEMPT
-
IGNORING
HER
EXPLANATIONS
AS
THOUGH
HE
WERE
A
SCHOOLMASTER
AND
SHE
A
SMALL
-
IGNORANT
CHILD
-
HE
GAVE
HER
NO
CHANCE
OF
ANY
PRIVATE
CONVERSATION
THAT
EVENING
-
FOR
WHEN
BLANCHE
AND
JACK
LEFT
-
HE
WENT
WITH
THEM
-
BUT
NEXT
MORNING
SHE
INSISTED
ON
HIS
TAKING
HER
OUT
IN
THE
JEEP
-
TO
FIND
-
IF
POSSIBLE
-
HUBERT
AND
HIS
HER
GREAT
DISAPPOINTMENT
AT
BEING
HELD
UP
IN
BALICOU
-
WITH
AN
AIR
OF
RESIGNATION
HE
SENT
JUDY
-
HIS
BOXER
-
TO
THE
BACK
-
AND
MADE
ROOM
FOR
HER
BESIDE
HIM
-
-
IS
THAT
ALL
YOU
WANT
TO
DO
-
-
HE
ASKED
-
LETTING
IN
THE
CLUTCH
-
-
NO
-
I
WANT
TO
MAKE
YOU
UNDERSTAND
JUST
WHAT
HAPPENED
ABOUT
THIS
BALICOU
TRIP
-
-
SHE
RETURNED
COLDLY
-
-
I
M
A
LITTLE
TIRED
OF
BEING
TREATED
LIKE
AN
INEFFECTIVE
IMBECILE
-
-
-
AND
I
M
HEARTILY
SICK
OF
BEING
CONSTANTLY
CALLED
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
MY
MANNERS
-
-
HE
RETORTED
-
-
WHAT
HAVE
I
DONE
WRONG
NOW
-
I
COVER
UP
FOR
YOU
THE
BEST
WAY
I
CAN
BY
GETTING
HOLD
OF
JACK
TO
MAKE
THE
PRESENTATION
-
I
RUN
THE
DAMNED
PARTY
TO
THE
BEST
OF
MY
ABILITY
-
SAYING
THE
SUGARY
THINGS
YOU
OUGHT
TO
HAVE
BEEN
THERE
FAULT
-
-
LOOK
AS
THOUGH
IT
WAS
ONLY
WHAT
YOU
EXPECTED
OF
ME
-
AND
HIS
PALS
DOWN
-
-
TO
UNDERSTAND
ALL
THE
WHYS
AND
WHEREFORES
OF
YOUR
ACTIONS
-
-
HE
SAID
STIFFLY
-
-
STILL
LESS
TO
CRITICISE
YOU
-
-
-
OH
-
DROP
THAT
NONSENSE
-
PIERS
-
BE
YOURSELF
-
-
SHE
EXCLAIMED
-
WITH
MOUNTING
EXASPERATION
-
-
VERY
WELL
-
-
HE
BROUGHT
THE
JEEP
TO
A
STANDSTILL
IN
A
ROUGH
PATH
FRINGED
AND
SHADED
BY
CITRUS
TREES
-
-
IF
YOU
WANT
MY
TRUE
OPINION
I
LL
GIVE
IT
-
YOU
MADE
SOME
SORT
OF
A
PROTEST
TO
GRAYBURY
-
I
LL
GIVE
YOU
CREDIT
FOR
THAT
-
BUT
YOU
DIDNT
PRESS
THE
MATTER
BECAUSE
-
VERY
NATURALLY
-
YOU
WERE
THOROUGHLY
ENJOYING
FORRESTS
COMPANY
IN
IDYLLIC
SURROUNDINGS
-
-
-
HOW
DARE
YOU
SAY
SUCH
A
THING
-
-
SHE
BLAZED
-
-
FOR
GOODNESS
SAKE
SHOW
A
GLIMMER
OF
REASON
-
-
WAS
HIS
EQUALLY
INDIGNANT
REJOINDER
-
SHE
AVOIDED
HIS
GAZE
-
AND
TRIED
TO
IGNORE
THAT
LAST
IMPERTINENT
REMARK
-
-
WITH
FOUR
OTHER
PEOPLE
-
-
-
WHOM
YOU
NEVER
ONCE
MANAGED
TO
CIRCUMVENT
-
-
THE
MOCKERY
IN
HIS
VOICE
HAD
DEEPENED
-
-
WITH
ALL
DUE
DEFERENCE
-
MISS
DEANE
-
COME
OFF
IT
-
-
SHE
MET
HIS
EYES
THEN
-
SLOWLY
-
-
IF
YOU
MUST
DRAG
THE
TRUTH
OUT
OF
ME
-
I
MUST
ASK
YOU
TO
REGARD
IT
AS
CONFIDENTIAL
-
-
-
MY
DEAR
BERYL
-
DONT
TELL
ME
ANYTHING
-
IF
YOU
D
RATHER
NOT
-
-
HE
WAS
CLEARLY
STARTLED
BY
HER
NOT
I
-
WHO
STARTED
THIS
CONVERSATION
-
-
-
I
KNOW
-
ABSURD
AS
IT
MAY
SEEM
-
I
DIDNT
WANT
YOU
TO
THINK
BADLY
OF
ME
-
-
SHE
TURNED
AWAY
FROM
HIM
TO
FONDLE
JUDY
-
WHO
-
SENSING
SOMETHING
AMISS
-
WAS
NUDGING
HER
IN
THE
ENDEAVOUR
TO
IF
I
HAD
ABSOLUTELY
INSISTED
ON
SAILING
AT
THE
HAVE
HAD
IT
IN
FOR
GUY
-
YOU
SEE
-
IT
WAS
-
APPARENTLY
-
THROUGH
A
MISTAKE
ON
GUYS
PART
THAT
WE
MISSED
SEEING
THE
FLAMINGOES
OUR
FIRST
MORNING
ON
THE
ISLAND
-
-
-
WHAT
HARM
COULD
POSSIBLY
HAVE
COME
TO
FORREST
THROUGH
SIR
JOHNS
NONSENSE
-
-
PIERS
COULD
HARDLY
HAVE
SPOKEN
WITH
MORE
CONTEMPT
-
A
BULLY
LIKE
THAT
RESPECTS
ANYONE
WHO
DARES
TO
STAND
UP
TO
HIM
-
-
BERYL
TRIED
TO
SUPPRESS
THE
THOUGHT
THAT
THIS
WAS
PRECISELY
THE
REMARK
SHE
HAD
MADE
TO
GUY
-
YOUR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
ALL
THE
AFFAIRS
OF
THE
ISLAND
I
NEEDNT
TELL
YOU
THAT
SIR
JOHN
GRAYBURY
IS
ONE
OF
MR
HEWSONS
MOST
IMPORTANT
CUSTOMERS
-
-
-
SO
WHAT
-
YOU
RE
NOT
FORREST
FOR
BEHAVING
WITH
ORDINARY
MORAL
COURAGE
-
HE
S
QUITE
CAPABLE
OF
TELLING
SIR
JOHN
TO
TAKE
HIMSELF
AND
HIS
BUSINESS
TO
AN
UNMENTION
ABLE
DESTINATION
-
-
-
THERE
S
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
WHAT
A
SENIOR
AND
A
JUNIOR
PARTNER
CAN
DO
-
-
WAS
HER
QUICK
REPLY
-
-
WHAT
THEY
CAN
BRING
OFF
-
I
LL
ADMIT
THAT
-
BUT
FORREST
MIGHT
AT
LEAST
HAVE
TRIED
-
HE
S
PRETTY
SPINELESS
-
-
-
YOU
THINK
YOU
COULD
HAVE
CARRIED
MORE
WEIGHT
WITH
SIR
JOHN
-
-
SHE
ENQUIRED
CUTTINGLY
-
AS
-
AS
A
GROUNDED
WHALE
-
-
HE
HAD
TO
SMILE
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
SHOW
MY
LADYLOVE
THAT
I
PUT
HER
INTERESTS
BEFORE
MY
OWN
-
SHE
WAS
TEMPTED
TO
LAUGH
-
BUT
IT
WAS
AS
THOUGH
THAT
BARB
STILL
STUCK
IN
HER
QUIVERING
FLESH
-
-
YOU
VE
AN
ANSWER
-
OF
SORTS
-
FOR
EVERYTHING
-
-
SHE
SAID
SHORTLY
-
-
PERSONALLY
I
VE
NO
MORE
TO
SAY
-
SO
I
SUGGEST
WE
GET
ALONG
-
-
TO
HER
GREAT
RELIEF
THEY
ARRIVED
AT
THE
CLUSTER
OF
LITTLE
HOUSES
INCREDIBLY
ANCIENT
CAR
-
SURROUNDED
BY
INNUMERABLE
FRIENDS
AND
RELATIVES
-
THEIR
AIR
OF
SMILING
SOMNOLENCE
SHOWED
THEM
CELEBRATIONS
-
AND
THEIR
FRIENDLY
WELCOME
AND
WARM
SYMPATHY
-
AS
SHE
EXPLAINED
HOW
SHE
HAD
COME
TO
MISS
THE
PARTY
-
MADE
HER
SEND
A
COMPLACENT
GLANCE
IN
PIERS
DIRECTION
-
WHAT
A
FUSSBOX
THE
MAN
WAS
-
SHE
THOUGHT
IMPATIENTLY
-
ON
THE
ESTATE
WAS
A
MAJOR
ERROR

AND
THEN
SHE
RECEIVED
A
JOLT

OLD
HUBERT

STANDING
BESIDE
HER

HIS
BATTERED
HAT
IN
HIS

3MISTAH

IT
WOULDNT

IN
THE
TEN
YEARS
OF

LIFE
THIS
HAD
ALREADY
HAPPENED
HALF
A
DOZEN
TIMES

SUCH
IS
THE
LIFE
OF
A
NAVAL
OFFICERS
WIFE
-
JOHNS
FATHER
HAD
BEEN
A
NAVAL
OFFICER
OF
THE
OLD
SCHOOL
-
SOME
OF
HIS
RIGID
IDEAS
HAD
BEEN
PASSED
ON
TO
THE
SECOND
GENERATION
-
ONE
OF
THESE
WAS
THAT
AN
OFFICER
SHOULD
JOIN
A

ON
TAKING

A
NEW
APPOINTMENT
-
AT
NINE
AM
PRECISELY
-
DRESSED
IN
THE

FOR
THE

KNOWN
BY
ALL
HABITUE
MAN
WHO
WAS
STARING
MOODILY
INTO

MUST
HAVE
BEEN
WORTH
A
GREAT

TO
THE

SHE
GREETED
JOHN

HOWEVER

WITH

JOHN
FOUGHT
BACK
HIS

IF

I
MUST
CONFESS
I
M
RELIEVED
-
BUT
IT
STILL
DOESNT
DO
AWAY
WITH
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
FAULTY
DESIGN
-
-
HE
HELD
OUT
HIS

-
-
MAYBE
I
WILL
TAKE
A
TRIP
WITH
YOU
I
LL
TELL
MY

GLAD

SAID
JOHN

-
I
SHALL
BE
BUSY
FOR
A
WHILE

CLEANING
UP
AFTER
MASTER
BLOODY
MUNYARD
-
-
THERE
WERE
SIX
SUBMARINES
-
LYING
IN
PAIRS
ALONGSIDE
THE
JETTY
AT
FORT
BLOCKHOUSE
-
BLACK
AND
GRIMLY
BUSINESSLIKE
THEY
BOTH
LOOKED
AND
SOUNDED
-
FOR
ALL
OF
THEM
WERE
RUMBLING
AS
THEY
CHARGED
THEIR
ELECTRIC
BATTERIES
-
A
LIGHT
WIND
WAFTED
THE
SMOKE
OF
DIESEL
EXHAUST
IN
THROUGH
THE
OPEN
WINDOWS
OF
THE
CAPTAINS
HOUSE
-
IT
PERVADED
EVERY
ROOM
BUT
NEITHER
HARRY
NOR
MADELEINE
TURTON
NOTICED
ITS
EXISTENCE
AS
THEY
SAT
IN
SILENCE
OVER
A
SUBSTANTIAL
BREAKFAST
-
ALTHOUGH
USUALLY
A
VERY
TALKATIVE
LADY
MADELEINE
RESPECTED
HER
HUSBANDS
SILENCES
-
FOR
SHE
KNEW
THEY
BETOKENED
A
WORRY
OF
SOME
SORT
-
THERE
HAD
BEEN
MANY
SUCH
BREAKFASTS
LATELY
SINCE
THE
AFFAIR
OF
PARSIFAL
-
HARRY
HAD
LOST
A
GOOD
DEAL
OF
WEIGHT
-
HIS
NORMAL
PLACID
AND
STEADYGOING
MANNER
REMAINED
-
BUT
SHE
COULD
SEE
THAT
IT
NO
LONGER
CAME
NATURALLY
-
IT
IS
THE
COMMON
LOT
OF
ALL
SQUADRON
SENIOR
OFFICERS
TO
EXPERIENCE
SUCH
CATASTROPHES
AS
THE
LOSS
OF
A
SUBMARINE
-
THOUGH
IN
PEACE
TIME
THESE
HAPPENINGS
ARE
FEW
AND
FAR
BETWEEN
-
THIS
IS
THE
TESTING
TIME
FOR
ALL
-
THE
AFFAIR
BLOWS
UP
INTO
A
NATIONAL
DISASTER
AND
THEN
WHEN
IT
IS
ALL
OVER
LIFE
MUST
CONTINUE
AS
BEFORE
-
DURING
THIS
PERIOD
THE
CAPTAIN
MUST
PRESENT
AN
UNRUFFLED
APPEARANCE
AND
CARRY
ON
AS
IF
NOTHING
UNUSUAL
HAS
HAPPENED
-
HARRY
TURTON
HAD
WRITTEN
LETTERS
TO
THE
BEREAVED
-
HAD
VISITED
MANY
IN
THE
LOCALITY
-
HAD
BEEN
INTERVIEWED
BY
THE
PRESS
-
HAD
DRIVEN
HIS
SURVIVING
SUBMARINES
A
GOOD
DEAL
HARDER
THAN
USUAL
AND
IN
FACT
HAD
APPLIED
ALL
THE
USUAL
SPECIFICS
SUITABLE
FOR
SUCH
OCCASIONS
-
HE
RODE
DOWN
TO
WHERE
I
WAS
WAITING
-
I
WAS
THINKING
WHAT
A
SKILL
HE
HAD
FOR
READING
MY
MIND
-
-
THIS
WOULD
BE
AS
GOOD
A
PLACE
NEAR
ME
-
-
YES
-
-
I
SAID
-
-
IT
LL
BE
HERE
TO
MORROW
AS
LIKELY
AS
NOT
-
-
I
PAUSED
-
-
MISS
JEANNIE
LL
BE
ON
THAT
COACH
-
DAN
-
-
-
YES
-
-
HE
SAID
-
-
I
KNOW
-
-
-
NO
HARM
MUST
COME
MEN
WHO
LL
BE
AFTER
THAT
COACH
I
M
INTERESTED
IN
-
JOHNNY
-
-
-
I
KNOW
-
BUT
IF
LEAD
STARTS
BUT
I
RECKON
THEY
LL
BE
TOO
BUSY
SHOOTING
AT
US
TO
BOTHER
WITH
THE
COACH
AND
THE
FOLKS
IN
IT
-
-
-
MAYBE
-
-
I
SAID
-
-
BUT
WE
VE
GOT
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
GIRL
ALL
THE
TIME
-
DAN
-
I
FEEL
KIND
OF
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
HER
-
-
-
OF
COURSE
-
-
HE
SAID
-
GIVING
ME
ONE
OF
HIS
STRANGE
LOOKS
-
THEN
HE
AND
HAVE
A
LOOK
AT
THE
MINING
CAMP
-
WORKING
FOR
-
AS
WELL
AS
THE
TOWNSFOLK
AND
THE
AGENCY
DETECTIVE
-
-
WITH
SOMETHING
OF
A
START
I
REMEMBERED
THE
MAN
WHO
D
BROUGHT
US
INTO
THIS
BUSINESS
-
-
MAYBE
YOU
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
APPLETON
-
I
SAID
-
I
WATCHED
HIM
BECAUSE
I
WAS
ALWAYS
FASCINATED
BY
THE
WAY
HE
LOOKED
WHEN
YOU
TRIED
TO
SURPRISE
HIM
-
-
DEAD
-
-
HE
SAID
-
-
YES
-
DEAD
-
SHUFFLED
OUT
OF
THE
DECK
-
BLASTED
DOWN
WITH
A
SHOTGUN
OUTSIDE
THE
PALACE
LAST
NIGHT
-
-
-
FENTON
OR
SOMERS
-
-
HE
SAID
-
-
OR
THE
TOWN
MARSHAL
-
-
I
ADDED
-
HIS
FACE
WAS
FIXED
-
HIS
HORSE
BACK
OFF
THE
TRAIL
AND
UP
THE
SLOPE
LEADING
TO
THE
RIDGE
-
I
FOLLOWED
-
FROM
THE
TOP
YOU
COULD
SEE
SOMETHING
OF
THE
WILD
HILL
COUNTRY
THAT
LAY
ALL
ROUND
GILBURG
CROSSING
-
THE
AIR
WAS
FRESH
AND
CLEAR
AND
YOU
COULD
SEE
FAR
OVER
WEST
AND
NORTH
FOR
MANY
MILES
-
THE
REAL
HIGH
COUNTRY
OF
THE
ROCKIES
LIFTED
UP
IN
THE
DISTANCE
LIKE
A
PALE
WATER
COLOUR
DRAWING
-
BETWEEN
US
AND
THAT
LAY
A
VAST
STRETCH
OF
HILLS
-
CANYONS
-
BUTTES
AND
MALPAIS
-
SAID
DAN
-
-
IF
WE
HEAD
WEST
WE
OUGHT
TO
CUT
THE
TRAIL
LEADING
FROM
GILBURG
TO
THE
NORTH
-
-
SO
WE
SWUNG
WEST
-
MAKING
SLOW
GOING
OVER
ROUGH
COUNTRY
-
SLIDING
ON
SHALE
-
CLIMBING
DOWN
INTO
DRAWS
-
CIRCLING
A
BIG
MESA
BY
A
FOUR
OR
FIVE
MILE
VALLEY
-
SANDYFLOORED
-
IT
GOT
HOTTER
AS
THE
DAY
WORE
ON
AND
WE
RESTED
GRATEFULLY
BY
A
SMALL
CREEK
WHERE
WE
WATERED
THE
HORSES
AND
DRANK
ENOUGH
TO
CURE
OUR
THIRST
-
AN
HOURS
RIDING
BROUGHT
US
TO
A
TRAIL
THAT
WE
TURNED
NORTH
INTO
IT
AND
AFTER
ABOUT
FOUR
MILES
IT
LED
INTO
A
SMALL
CANYON
WHICH
OPENED
OUT
INTO
A
WIDE
SHALLOW
DRAW
-
HERE
IN
A
DRIEDUP
CREEKBED
WE
FOUND
THE
MINERS
AT
WORK
-
THEY
WERE
SCATTERED
OVER
A
FAIRLY
WIDE
AREA
WORKING
SINGLY
OR
OF
THE
DIGGINGS
THERE
WAS
A
ROUGHLYBUILT
SHACK
AND
AS
WE
GOT
NEAR
SOMEONE
INSIDE
BAWLED
OUT
-
-
IF
YOU
COME
ANY
CLOSER
-
I
LL
SURE
BLOW
YOUR
WHISKERS
OFF
-
-
-
TAKE
IT
EASY
-
MISTER
-
-
I
SANG
GOT
NO
WHISKERS
SO
AS
YOU
CAN
SEE
-
JUST
YOU
GO
AND
TELL
NICK
DOWD
WE
VE
COME
TO
TALK
TO
HIM
ABOUT
WHAT
HAPPENED
LAST
NIGHT
-
-
WHISTLE
THEN
-
LOUD
AND
SHRILL
-
THE
GUN
BARREL
PEEKING
OUT
THROUGH
A
HOLE
IN
THE
SHACK
NEVER
WAVERED
-
WE
SAT
OUR
HORSES
-
WAITING
-
-
LOOKS
AS
THOUGH
THEY
RE
EXPECTING
TROUBLE
-
-
I
SAID

WHERE
OBSERVED

MR
COPTHORNE
KNEW
A
WAY
ROUND
BY
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
CHURCH
WHERE
THERE
WAS
A
SMALL
OPEN
OUTBUILDING
WHERE
THE
GRAVE
DIGGER
KEPT
HIS
SPADES
AND
FORKS
AND
TIDYING
UP
IMPLEMENTS
-
IT
MIGHT
BE
OPEN
-
IT
WAS
-
HE
ENTERED
-
AND
SEATED
HIMSELF
IN
A
HUDDLE
UPON
AN
UPTURNED
WHEELBARROW
-
HIS
CURIOUS
HEADGEAR
FELL
OFF
-
STRANGE
THINGS
WERE
GOING
ON
IN
HIS
BEWILDERED
BRAIN
-
WHEN
A
MAN
WAS
DROWNING
AND
TOWARDS
HIS
LAST
GASP
IT
WAS
SCIENTIFICALLY
SUPPOSED
HIS
WHOLE
LIFE
CAME
UP
BEFORE
HIM
IN
SOME
CINEMATIC
OUTBUILDING
-
BUT
THIS
WAS
HAPPENING
TO
HIM
NOW
-
HE
SAW
HIMSELF
AS
A
SULKY
-
UGLY
-
MALFORMED
-
REPRESSED
BOY
-
THEN
A
YOUNG
YOUTH
-
HE
SAW
HIMSELF
REFUSING
BAPTISM
ACCORDING
TO
THE
SECT
HIS
PARENTS
BELONGED
TO
-
ON
-
HIS
LEAPING
MIND
FLASHED
PICTURES
OF
CHI
CANERY
AND
CORRUPTION
-
THE
GROWTH
OF
THE
DEA
DLY
DECADENCE
AND
ABSORPTION
IN
DEBASE
MENT
AND
SATANIC
DEBAUCHERY
-
HE
DIDNT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
MAKE
OF
IT
-
BUT
IT
WAS
MR
COPTHORNE
ALL
RIGHT
-
PERHAPS
HE
HAD
BEEN
ATTENDING
SOME
KIND
OF
FANCY
DRESS
DO
IN
LONDON
-
VERY
STRANGE
HIS
EYES
LOOKED
-
MAD
-
HUNTED
EYES
-
AS
IF
THE
POOR
FELLOW
HAD
ROCKS
IN
HIS
HEAD
-
SO
THE
VERGER
DESCRIBED
AFTERWARDS
-
SPEAK
NORMALLY
-
-
YES

I
TRAVELLED
DOWN
FROM
LONDON
AS
THE
DAWN
WAS
BREAKING

AND
LED
THE
WAY
IN

-
THE
STAINED
GLASS
THERE
WERE
FEW
PASSENGERS
ON

AND
GAVIN
WAS
QUICKLY
THROUGH
THE
CUSTOMS
-
-
GAY
-
-
-
GAVIN
-
-
THE
GIRL
AND
HER
LUGGAGE
HAD
DISAPPEARED
AND
THEY
WERE
ALONE
TOGETHER
-
THE
PORTER
BROUGHT
GAVINS

THE
HAND
AND
SMILED

-
I
WANT
TO
CHECK
UP
ON
THE
FLIGHTS

OUT
TO
THE
WAITING
TAXI

AND
THEN
FOUND
THAT
IN
THE
EXCITEMENT
OF
MEETING
GAVIN
SHE
HAD
LEFT
HER
SUN
GLASSES
ON
THE
VERANDA
-
SHE
WENT
QUICKLY
BACK
TO
FETCH
THEM
-
GAVIN
AND
THE
GIRL
WHO
HAD
GOT
OFF
THE
PLANE
WITH
HIM
WERE
TALKING
-
HE
WAS
WRITING
SOMETHING
IN
HIS
POCKETBOOK

WITH
A
SICK
FEELING
OF
DESPAIR
GAY
KNEW
THAT

MISERABLE
-
SHY

WHO
HAD
SAT
AT
THE

GAVIN
RAISED
HIS
GLASS
TO
HER
AND
SMILED
AND
GAYS
HEART
TURNED
OVER
-
-
I
D
LIKE
TO
DO
THAT
-
-
GAVIN
DRAINED
HIS
GLASS
AND
REFILLED
IT
-
-
AND
THEN
WE
LL
GO
FOR
A
STROLL
ALONG
THE
BEACH
-
A
MOON
LIKE
THIS
MUSTNT
BE
WASTED
-
-
HE
GESTURED
TOWARDS
THE
BAY
WHERE
THE
FULL
MOON

JUST
RISING
OVER
THE
ROCKS
-
THEN
LAID
HIS
HAND

GAY
SMILED
AT
HIM

YET
REMEMBERING
FOR
A
SECOND
THE
KISSES
SHE
HAD
SEEN
HIM
GIVING
ELAINE

ALL
THAT
WAS
PART
OF
THE
PAST
-
SHE
WOULD
PUT
IT
BEHIND
HER

SHE
WOULD
NEVER
BE
JEALOUS
AGAIN
-
WOULD
EVEN
TAKE
LARRYS
ADVICE
AND
LOOK
THE
OTHER
WAY
IF
NEED
BE

WALKED
OUT
ON
TO
THE
TERRACE
THINKING
THAT
PERHAPS
GAVIN
HAD
BOUGHT
A
DRINK
AND
TAKEN
IT
OUTSIDE
-
SHE
LOOKED
ROUND
SCANNING
THE
TABLES
-
THEN
CAUGHT
HER
BREATH
-
A
COLD
HAND
SEEMING
TO
CLUTCH
HER
HEART
-
GAVIN
WAS
SEATED
AT
A
SMALL
TABLE
IN
A
SHADOWY
CORNER
TALKING
ANIMATEDLY
TO
SIMONE
-
AS
GAY
WATCHED

ALTHOUGH
HE
HAD
TOLD
HER
THAT
HE
LOVED
HER

WAS
ALREADY
FLIRTING
WITH
A
GIRL
THAT
HE
HAD
ONLY
MET
A

GESTURE
OF
HOPELESSNESS

TOLD

VIEW
AND
REMEMBERING
THE
ADVICE
THAT
LARRY
HAD
GIVEN
HER
-
WHILE
SHE
FELT
WRETCHED
BEYOND
WORDS
-
HIS
BEHAVIOUR
WAS
NOT
ONLY
BOORISH
AND
IN
THE
WORST
OF
TASTE
BUT
IT
WAS
UNKIND
BEYOND
WORDS
-
SHE
FUMBLED
WITH
THE
CIGARETTE
PACKET
WHICH
LAY
ON
THE
TABLE
NOT
WANTING
TO
SMOKE
BUT
NEEDING
SOME
ACTION

SURE
THAT
PEOPLE

BEEN
OVER
TO
SIT
WITH
HER

HELPLESS
STILL

GOING
TO

A
FOREIGNER

ELAINE
WAS
ENGAGED
-
TO
THE
MAN
SHE
HAD
SPENT
SO
MUCH
TIME
WITH
AT
HER
PARTY
-
THAT
WAS
WHY
GAVIN
HAD
COME
BACK
TO

QUITE
CLEAR
NOW
-
AND
TO
HER
OWN
SURPRISE
GAY
FELT
NO
HEARTBREAK
-
RATHER
A
SENSE
OF
RELIEF
NOW
THAT
SHE
KNEW
WHY
GAVIN
HAD
COME
TO
SEE
HER
-
UNDERSTAND
-
KNOWING
THAT
GAY
WAS
AS
MUCH
ASHAMED
FOR
GAVIN
AT
THE
WAY
HE
WAS

AS
SHE

HURT
FOR
HERSELF
-
-
I
MADE

DIANA
WILLS
OFTEN
SAT
ON
THE
BRAND
NEW
SEAT
OUTSIDE
THE
HOSPITAL
GATES
AND
THOUGHT
VAGRANT
THOUGHTS
-
AT
ONE
TIME
SHE
HAD
WATCHED
THE
WORKMEN
CONSTRUCTING
TO
PUT
ST
JOHNS
CASUALTY
DEPARTMENT
OUT
OF
OPERATION
-
IN
THEORY
-
AT
LEAST
-
SHE
WOULD
THINK
OF
HER
SELF
AS
A
STRANGER
IN
THESE
PARTS
MAN
OF
THE
ROAD
HIS
FREEDOM
OF
DECISION
-
AND
WISHING
LIFE
WOULD
SOMETIMES
ALLOW
SERIOUSMINDED
WOMEN
DOCTORS
TO
BLOW
A
FEATHER
AND
FOLLOW
ITS
AIRY
DIRECTIONS
ACCORDINGLY
-
-
IF
I
WERE
NEEDING
A
JOB
I
D
GO
TO
LONDON
-
OF
COURSE
-
-
SHE
WENT
ON
-
-
THERE
ARE
ALL
SORTS
OF
WONDER
FUL
JOBS
IN
LONDON
AND
I
COULD
ONE
HAS
TO
KNOW
SOMETHING
ABOUT
FISHING
AND
IN
LIVERPOOL
THEY
D
WANT
SEAFARERS
-
I
DONT
THINK
I
D
GO
TO
EDINBURGH
UN
LESS
I
WAS
A
SCOT
AND
WANTING
TO
GET
HOME
-
OR
PERHAPS
A
STUDENT
STUDYING
TO
BE
A
DOCTOR
-
AND
I
ALREADY
KNOW
ALL
ABOUT
THAT
-
-
SHE
WAS
ENGAGED
TO
NIGEL
-
HAD
BEEN
FOR
TWO
YEARS
-
SOMETIMES
THEY
TALKED
ON
THE
THEME
OF
-
WHEN
WE
GET
MARRIED
-
-
AND
THEN
ALL
WAS
WONDERFUL
-
AND
PERHAPS
IT
HAD
ONLY
BEEN
A
SLIP
OF
THE
TONGUE
WHEN
NIGEL
HAD
SAID
-
ONLY
LAST
THAT
LARK
-
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
-
-
WORD
SHOUTED
INTO
HER
VERY
SOUL
A
HORN
OF
WARNING
-
AND
WITH
IT
WAS
COUPLED
A
DISEMBODIED
FRAGMENT
OF
INFORMATION
-
SEEN
IN
FARLINGHAM
ON
AN
OCCASION
HE
HAD
SWORN
HE
HAD
BEEN
STANDING
IN
FOR
LUKE
PARSONS
AT
HIS
SURGERY
IN
LITTLE
PHELPHAM
-
NOW
NIGEL
HAD
EVERY
RIGHT
TO
GO
WHERE
HE
WHEN
SHE
WAS
NOT
FREE
-
THIS
MUCH
THEY
HAD
CONCEDED
ONE
TO
THE
OTHER
-
THEY
RARELY
FOUND
THEY
WERE
OFF
DUTY
TOGETHER
-
AND
THE
SITUATION
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
INTOLERABLE
ABOUT
THEIR
RELATIONSHIP
-
SO
WHEN
NIGEL
HAD
TOLD
HER
ABOUT
TAKING
LUKES
EVENING
SURGERY
SHE
HAD
SAID
-
HE
SHRUGGED
DIFFIDENTLY
-
-
I
LIKE
THE
WORK

ONE
GETS
PLENTY
OF
VARIETY
AND
IT

A
CHANGE

I
SUPPOSE
-
TO

A
RING
-
OK
-
-

HAD
REPLIED
READILY
-
SO
HOW
COULD

BEEN
AT
THE
LOAD
OF
TROUBLE
ROADHOUSE

NIGEL
FROM

BACK
-
DJ
AND
ALL

OF

SUCH
AS
I
COULDNT
AFFORD
TO
GO
INTO

NO

SAID
IMMEDIATELY

IT

BUT
AFTER
THAT
SLIGHT
SLIP
OF
THE
TONGUE
ON
NIGELS
PART
SHE
HAD
REALISED
IT
WAS
IMPORTANT
ENOUGH
FOR
HER
TO
HAVE
REMEMBERED
-
AND
IT
WAS
AS
THOUGH
A
RED
MIST
VEILED
HER
USUALLY
CLEAR
SIGHT
AND
MADE
HER
THINK
THERE
WAS
AN
ABYSS
IMMEDIATELY
AHEAD

NIGEL

SHE
HAD
BESOUGHT
HIM
-

YOU

THERE
WAS
A
WOMAN
WITH
A
CYST
ON
HER
EAR
-
-
-
-
5YEES
-
-
HE
LOWERED
HIS
EYES
AND
KISSED
HER
ON
THE
MOUTH
-
AN
ACT
OF
DEVOTION
HE
DIDNT
OVERINDULGE
-
-
WHAT
ABOUT
IT
-
MY
SWEET
-
-
-
WELL
-
-
SHE
LAUGHED
SUDDENLY
IN
AN
UPSURGING
OF
RELIEF
-
-
THAT
STUPID
GUBBINS
BOY
THOUGHT
HE
SAW
YOU
AT
THE

OF

-
WITH
A
BLONDE
-
TOO
-
IMAGINE
-
-
NIGEL
WAS
FROWNING
-
HE
LOOKED
DISTINGUISHED
WHEN
HE
FROWNED
-
BOYISHLY
THOUGH
DIANA
KNEW
THE
NAME
OF
EVERY
MEMBER
OF
THE
STAFF
-
DISTINGUISHED
OR
NOT
-
NIGEL
OFTEN
HAD
TO
THINK
HARD
TO
SORT
HE
NOW
DEMANDED
-
-
WHAT
WAS
HE
-
OH

HE
WASNT

HIS
MOTORBIKE
HAD
BROKEN
DOWN

HE
NOTICED

YOU
DANCING

-
-
REALLY
-

NIGEL
COCKED

ACTUALLY
SHE
WAS
BRUNETTE
AT
THE

AND
I
HAD
A

HE
WOULD
HAVE
TOLD
YOU

-
NO

SHE
LAUGHED

HE
DIDNT
ACTUALLY
SEE

ALL
DRESSED

STILL
PLAYFULLY

WITHOUT

IN

HOWEVER

THE
LOOK
OF
ADMIRATION
AND
REVELATION
WHICH
HAD
FOLLOWED

THEN
REGARDED
THE
RING
WHICH
HE
RETRIEVED

THUS
HAD
THEY
PARTED
THE
PREVIOUS
EVENING
AND
NOW
DIANA
WAS
TRAILING
UP
THE

THEY
OFTEN
HAD

AND
AS

THE
THOUGHT
VULSION
THAT
WAS
HOMICIDAL

TIED
-
HE
DARE
NOT
PRECIPITATE
WHAT
MIGHT
WELL
BE
ANOTHER
MANTLE
-
AND
SAID
WITH
SUCH
-
I
WILL
LEAVE
YOU
THE

FROM

THEN
-
WITH
A
GESTURE
SHE
KNEW
SO

HE
TORE
OFF
THE
LEAFLET
AND
WITH
A
DEADLY
FINALITY
-
WATCHING
HIM
GO

UNABLE

SHE
FELT
THAT
PART
OF

WAS
LEAVING

SHE
COULDNT
HATE
HIM

NATION
-
NOW
THERE
WAS
NO
THING

NOT
EVEN
FRIENDSHIP
-
SHE
WENT
BACK
TO
PHILIP

BUT
ALL
SHE
COULD
HEAR
WERE
NICHOLASS
LOVE

SHE
REVOLTED
AGAINST
THE
WORD
-
NICHOLAS
-
PHILIP
-
WHERE
WAS
HAPPINESS
-
OR
PEACE
OF

PHILIP
PUT
OUT
A
HAND
AND
GRASPED
HERS
-
HE
NEEDED
HER
-
SHE
WOULD
FIND
SOLACE
IN
THAT
FACT
AT

-
SHE
HAD
HER
TRUTH

HOW
MUCH
HAD
BUILT
UP
FROM
THAT
FIRST
IDEAL

AND
HOW
HELL
LYING
THERE

KNOWING
SHE
WAS
SAID
INSTINCTIVELY

I
TOLD
HIM
I
KNEW
HE
WAS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
HER

DARKENED
IN
TORMENT

GOOD
HEAVENS

DARLING

WHY
ON

NO

HOW
ONE
MIGHT
WANT
TO
TOUCHED
HIM
AFTER
THE
COLD
WIND
OF
SUSPENSE
-
-
IT
WILL
BE
INTERESTING
WILL
MATTER
MOST
-
-
STRANGE
HOW
JUST
THEN
PHILIP
WAS
SO
CERTAIN
THAT
NICHOLAS
WOULD
NEVER
BETRAY
HIM
-
HE
LOVED
SANDRA
TOO
DEEPLY
TO
RUIN
HER
FUTURE
HAPPINESS
-
HAD
EVER

HE
WAS
BETTER

HE
HAD
MADE
A
MIRACULOUS
RECOVERY
AND
SANDRA
WOULD
SOON
BE
HIS

CERTAINLY
LOOKED
AFTER

SOMETHING

ATTITUDE
STRUCK
PATRONIZING
WORD

SHE
REPLIED

IN
THAT
SECOND

SHE
KNEW

GOT
ON
HIS

BUT
EVERYTHING
HAD
GONE
OVER
HER
HEAD
-
IT
DIDNT
REALLY
MATTER
WHAT
WAS
BEING
SAID
BECAUSE
SHE
WAS
NO
LONGER
A
PART
OF
IT

THE
THOUGHT
OF
NICHOLAS
HAUNTED
HER

THE
SENSE
OF
LOSS
CRUCIFYING

HER
FATHERS
COMMENT
ROUSED
HER
AS
HE
SAID

I
PRESUME
WE
SHALL
BE
ALLOWED
TO
HAVE

HIS
MOTHER
INSISTED

AND

WHILST
I
GET
DINNER
READY
-
-
CECIL
WRIGGLED
IRRITABLY
UNDER
THE
MISPLACED
MANAGEMENT
OF
A
MOTHER
WHO
HAD
FAILED
TO
REALISE
THAT
A
SON
WHO
IS
NEARLY
BALD
IS
NO
LONGER
A
BABY
-
HE
STARTED
TO
CLIMB
THE
STAIRS
-
STAMPING
WITH
UNNECESSARY
VIGOUR
UPON
THE
TREADS
-
-
AND
DONT
WIPE
THE
DIRT
OFF
ON
THE
TOWEL
LIKE
YOU
DID
YESTERDAY
-
YOUR
AUNTIE
EDIE
S
COMING
IN
FOR
A
CUP
OF
TEA
LATER
AND
MOTHER
TURNED
AROUND
IN
TIME
TO
SEE
THE
BRIEFCASE
COLLAPSE
AGAINST
THE
BRASS
UMBRELLA
STAND
-
-
WELL
NOW
-
-
SHE
HURRIED
TOWARDS
IT
AND
PICKED
IT
UP
-
WHAT
IT
S
ALL
ABOUT
-
-
CECIL
HALTED
IN
MIDSTEP
NEAR
THE
TOP
OF
THE
STAIRS
AND
TURNING
ROUND
-
SHE
POINTED
TO
THE
IRRITABLE
-
YOU
THOUGHT
THAT
I
D
THINK
UPSTAIRS
WITH
IT
-
-
AND
I
VE
NOT
BEEN
EXTRAVAGANT
-
-
-
NAUGHTY
-
-
SHE
CALLED
IN
SPITE
OF
ALL
THE
TRANSFERRED
MATERNITY
SHE
WAS
ENDOWED
WITH
BY
HER
PATIENTS
-
INFANTINARMS
BUT
A
NEWBORN
BABE
-
A
PREMATURE
PIECE
OF
FRAILTY
IN
AN
OXYGEN
TENT
OF
UTTER
INNOCENCE
-
THE
COMPLEXITY
OF
THAT
INNOCENCE
WAS
COLOSSAL
-
IT
HAD
LAYER
AFTER
LAYER
OF
ILLUSION
TO
BE
PEELED
OFF
AND
REPLACED
WITH
SAD
KNOWLEDGEABILITY
-
IT
WAS
A
NAKEDNESS
OF
NAIVETY
TO
BE
CLOTHED
LEAF
BY
LEAF
WITH
THE
DISAPPOINTMENT
OF
EXPERIENCE
-
HER
FIRST
ILLUSION
CONSISTED
IN
THE
BELIEF
THAT
ALL
SHE
NEED
DO
WAS
TO
GO
TO
AN
AGENT
-
VISIT
HALF
A
DOZEN
HOUSES
IN
ONE
DAY
-
CHOOSE
ONE
-
MAKE
AN
OFFER
-
PUT
IT
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
A
LAWYER
AND
GO
AWAY
ON
HER
HOLIDAY
WHILE
THE
WHOLE
TRANSACTION
WAS
PUT
THROUGH
-
FORTUNATELY
-
HOWEVER
-
THE
FASHION
FOR
VICTORIAN
ARCHITECTURE
WHICH
MR
JOHN
BETJEMAN
HAD
STARTED
SEVERAL
DECADES
BEFORE
HAD
CAUGHT
ON
AT
LAST
AND
THEREFORE
SAVED
THE
SITUATION
FOR
THE
AFFLUENT
MIDDLECLASS
-
WHO
NOW
HAD
PLENTY
SERENA
DISCOVERED
-
AND
MORE
-
BUT
IN
STAGES
-
FOR
THE
FIRST
THING
SHE
DID
WAS
TO
MAKE
AN
OFFER
SMALL
BACK
YARD
-
NEWLY
DEC
-
NEAR
SHOPS
AND
TUBE
THE
NEXT
THING
THAT
SERENA
DISCOVERED
WAS
THAT
AND
THIS
IN
SPITE
OF
HAVING
AT
LAST
MANAGED
TO
SAVE
THE
TEN
PERCENT
NEEDED
-
OR
SO
SHE
THOUGHT
-
BEING
THEN
IN
POSSESSION
OF
WHAT
SEEMED
TO
HER
THE
PRINCELY
SUM
OF
SIX
HUND
RED
POUNDS
-
THE
LAWYER
SAID
-
-
OF
COURSE
YOU
MUST
COUNT
ABOUT
TWO
HUNDRED
FOR
LEGAL
CHARGES
AND
STAMP
DUTIES
-
MAYBE
LESS
-
DEPENDING
ON
THE
PRICE
OF
THE
HOUSE
-
AND
WHETHER
IT
HAS
BEEN
REGIS
TERED
-
I
TAKE
IT
YOU
HAVE
A
MORTGAGE
LINED
UP
-
THEN
-
MRS
-
ER
-
BUTTERY
-
-
-
NOT
YET
-
BUT
THE
BANK
WOULD
GIVE
ME
A
LOAN
-
I
M
SURE
-
-
-
ER
-
YES
-
YOU
HAVE
SOME
SECURITIES
-
HIS
ASPECT
WAS
AS
DUSTY
AS
HIS
OFFICE
-
WITH
SCURF
FROM
DUSTY
HAIR
ON
THE
DUSTY
SHOULDERS
OF
HIS
BLACK
SUIT
-
CIGARETTE
ASH
DOWN
THE
FRONT
-
AN
ASHEN
FACE
AND
YELLOW
SLEEPY
DUST
IN
THE
CORNERS
OF
HIS
PALE
GREY
EYES
-
HIS
FINGERNAILS
WERE
DIRTY
-
THOUGH
HE
TRIED
TO
MAKE
UP
FOR
IT
BY
CONSTANTLY
PARING
THEM
WITH
THE
FINGERNAIL
OF
THE
OPPOSITE
HAND
-
HIS
VOICE
WAS
LIKE
HIS
BLACK
AND
PINSTRIPE
-
A
GREY
SUPERIMPOSITION
OF
RESPECTABILITY
OVER
THE
RESULT
BEING
SOMEHOW
AS
INEFFECTIVE
-
NOT
JUST
DUSTYGREY
BUT
MUDDY
-
SLIMY
EVEN
-
PURPOSE
THAN
THE
THROWING
OF
DUST
IN
HIS
THE
FAKE
FRIEND
OF
THE
FAMILY
-
LIKE
THE
-
YES

WELL

HE
JUDGED
THAT
SHE

BEEN
SUFFICIENTLY
DAZZLED
AND
GAVE
A
LONG

ALL

THAT

NO

THE

TOO

WHEN

-
-
NOW
-
AFTER
A
WOMANS

SHE
DECIDED
PIERRE

THIS

WRESTLING
WITH

OF

-
WE
WERE
WOKEN
UP
TWICE
ABOUT
DAWN
BY
A
SOFT
ERUPTION
OF
TURTLEDOVES

THIS
WAS
STRANGE

EVEN
MAGIC

WHEN

AN

AND
WE
LOOKED
OUT
OF

AT
THE
WEEPING
TREES
AND
THE
CURLING
WHITE
BREATH
OF
THE
MOUNTAINS
-
THE

FRONTPAGE
REARATTACK
ON

BETWEEN

-
ALL
THE
MURDERS
WERE
WELL

AND
HAD
THE
AIR
OF
BEING
WRITTEN
BY
AN
INGENIOUS

BY
AN
ELDERLY

LABOURER
OUT
FOR
A

WHO
HID
HIMSELF
IN
A

AND
IMITATED
A

HOWEVER

PELLETS
WERE
EASILY
REMOVED

THE
LABOURER
WAS
ABLE
TO

YOU
CAN
FREEWHEEL
DOWN
A
QUARTER
OF

IN

OF
THE

A
VALLEY
WITH
A
SEA
OF

BUT
BETWEEN
ARE
POCKETS
OF
HEAT

COLD
LIKE
THE
HANDS
OF
FRIENDS

STRANGERS

AND
A
FLURRY
OF
EARLY
SMELLS
-
THE
DARK
BOSOMS
OF
BEECH
AND
THE
THIN
PINE
FINGERS
KISSED
BY

DREAMS
ON
MY
TONGUE

WE
PARKED
THE

OPPOSITE
THE

TO
HAVE
A
SWIM

AMAZING
BEDLAM
ROCKED
IN
OUR

THE

BOILED
WITH

THEY
GALLOPED
TO
THE

AND
SPUMED
OVER
THE

A
HUGE
CROWD
HAD
COLLECTED

THERE
WERE
FIREMEN
AND
POLICEMEN
AND
AMBULANCES

AND
THE
EYES
OF
THE
SPECTATORS
WERE
HARD
WITH
THEY
ALL
HAD
THAT
NEAT
LOOK
OF
MEDITERRANEAN
PEOPLE
TO
WHOM
NOTHING

HAPPEN

THE

THE
UNCUCKOLDED

WOULD
RING
FOR
THEM
-
THE
GILDED
LOVE
HOUSE
-
THE
MAD
GRANDMOTHER
OR
THE
BLOODY
CHILD
AT
THE
CROSSROADS
-
IT
WAS
GROWING
COLD
-
WE
LEFT
THE
CROWD
AND
DROVE
BACK
TO
VENCE

THE
COOL
EVENING
PERFUMES
STOOD
BECKONING
AT
THE
CORNERS
OF

MART

UNABLE

HER

IMPAIRED
YEARS
AGO

AND
I
HAD
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
LOW

SHARP
AND
SWEET
SIGNALS
IN
THE
AIR
-
WHEN
WE
GOT
BACK
HOME
WE
FELT
EXHAUSTED
-
LONDON
SICKNESS
-
A
SENSE
OF
GUILT
-
MINGLED
WITH
THE
MEMORY
OF
SANDWICHES
THE
TURTLEDOVES
DRUMMED
UP
THE
SUN
-
THE
NEXT
MORNING
-
IN
THE
SQUARE
OPPOSITE
PIERRES
-
I
READ
ABOUT
THE
NICE

CATASTROPHE
IN
THE
PATRIOTE
-
MART
HAD
BEEN
RIGHT
-
THE
BODY
HAD
BEEN
A
WOMANS
-
IT
BELONGED
TO
A
MADAME
N
ENQUIRIES
HAD
BEEN
MADE
IN
THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD

AND
IT
TRANSPIRED
THAT
MADAME

HAD
MADE
AN
ARRANGEMENT
WITH
THE
DEAD
LADYS

BUT
INSTEAD
OF
RETURNING

HAD
AN

-
SHE
WENT
TO
HER
FIANCE2S
HOUSE
AND
REPORTED
HER
TO
THE
POLICE

AND
THEN
JUMPED
OFF
A
CLIFF
NEAR
MONTE
CARLO

THE
DAY
I
PROMISED
TO
TAKE
CATHERINE
DOWN
TO
VISIT
MY
YOUNG
FRIEND
PHILIP
AT
HIS

IN
THE

-
WE
WERE
TO
LEAVE

SHE
ARRIVED
AT

HER
BLUE
DRESS
WAS
NEW
-
AND
SO
WERE
HER
FASHIONABLE
SHOES
-
HER
HAIR
HAD
JUST
BEEN
DONE
-
SHE
LOOKED
MORE
THAN
EVER
LIKE
A
PINK

GOLD
RENOIR
GIRL
WHO
EXPECTS
EVERYTHING
FROM
LIFE
-
CATHERINE
LIVES
IN
A
WHITE
HOUSE
OF
THE

SHE
HELPED
ME
CLEAN
UP
MY
FLAT
WITH
A
DEVOTION
WHICH
SAID
THAT
SHE
FELT
SMALL
FLATS
WERE
ALTOGETHER
MORE
ROMANTIC
THAN
LARGE
HOUSES
-
WE
DRANK
TEA
-
AND
TALKED
MAINLY
ABOUT
PHILIP
-
WHO
-
THING
FROM
FOOD
TO
MUSIC
-
CATHERINE
LOOKED
AT
THE
BOOKS
LYING
AROUND
HIS
ROOM
-
AND
ASKED
IF
SHE
MIGHT
BORROW
THE
STORIES
OF
ISAAC
BABEL
TO
READ
ON
THE
TRAIN
-
CATHERINE
IS
13
-
NEWSPAPERS
AND
WATCHED
HER
PRETTY
FROWNING
FACE
AS
SHE
TURNED
THE
PAGES
OF
BABEL
-
FOR
SHE
WAS
DETERMINED
TO
LET
NOTHING
GET
BETWEEN
HER
AND
AT
THE
SCHOOL
-
WHICH
IS
CHARMING
-
CI
VILISED
AND
EXPENSIVE
-
THE
TWO
CHILDREN
WALKED
TOGETHER
ACROSS
GREEN
FIELDS
-
AND
I
FOLLOWED
-
SEEING
HOW
THE
SUN
GILDED
THEIR
BRIGHT
FRIENDLY
HEADS
TURNED
TOWARDS
EACH
OTHER
AS
THEY
TALKED
-
IN
CATHERINES
LEFT
HAND
SHE
CARRIED
THE
STORIES
OF
ISAAC
BABEL
-
AFTER
LUNCH
WE
WENT
TO
THE
PICTURES
-
PHILIP
ALLOWED
-
IT
TO
BE
SEEN
THAT
HE
THOUGHT
GOING
TO
THE
PICTURES
JUST
FOR
THE
FUN
OF
IT
WAS
FOR
HIS
SAKE
WE
CHOSE
THE
MORE
SERIOUS
OF
THE
TWO
FILMS
THAT
WERE
SHOWING
IN
THE
LITTLE
TOWN
-
IT
WAS
ABOUT
A
GOOD
PRIEST
WHO
HELPED
CRI
MINALS
IN
NEW
YORK
-
HIS
GOODNESS
-
HOW
EVER
-
WAS
NOT
ENOUGH
TO
PREVENT
ONE
OF
THEM
FROM
BEING
SENT
TO
THE
GAS
CHAMBER
-
AND
PHILIP
AND
I
WAITED
WITH
CATHERINE
IN
THE
DARK
UNTIL
SHE
HAD
STOPPED
CRYING
AND
COULD
FACE
THE
LIGHT
OF
A
GOLDEN
EVENING
-
AT
THE
ENTRANCE
OF
THE
CINEMA
THE
DOORMAN
WAS
LYING
IN
WAIT
FOR
ANYONE
BY
HER
SUFFERING
ARM
-
HE
SAID
BITTERLY
-
-
YES
-
WHY
ARE
YOU
CRYING
-
HE
HAD
TO
BE
PUNISHED
FOR
HIS
CRIME
-
DIDNT
HE
-
-
CATHE
RINE
STARED
AT
HIM
-
INCREDULOUS
-
PHILIP
RESCUED
HER
BY
SAYING
WITH
DISDAIN
-
-
SOME
PEOPLE
DONT
KNOW
RIGHT
FROM
WRONG
EVEN
WHEN
ITS
DEMONSTRATED
TO
THEM
-
-
THE
DOORMAN
TURNED
HIS
ATTENTION
TO
THE
NEXT
REDEYED
EMERGER
FROM
THE
DARK
-
AND
WE
WENT
ON
TOGETHER
TO
THE
STATION
-
THE
CHILDREN
SILENT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
CRUELTY
OF
THE
WORLD
-
FINALLY
CATHERINE
SAID
-
HER
EYES
WET
AGAIN
-
-
I
THINK
ITS
ALL
ABSOLUTELY
BEASTLY
-
AND
I
CANT
BEAR
TO
THINK
ABOUT
IT
-
-
AND
PHILIP
SAID
-
-
BUT
WE
VE
GOT
TO
THINK
ABOUT
IT
-
DONT
YOU
SEE
-
BECAUSE
IF
WE
DONT
IT
LL
JUST
GO
ON
AND
ON
-
DONT
YOU
SEE
-
-
IN
THE
TRAIN
GOING
BACK
TO
LONDON
I
SAT
BESIDE
-
CATHERINE
-
SHE
HAD
THE
STORIES
OPEN
IN
FRONT
OF
HER
-
BUT
SHE
SAID
-
-
PHILIP
S
AWFULLY
LUCKY
-
I
WISH
I
WENT
TO
THAT
SCHOOL
-
DID
YOU
NOTICE
THAT
GIRL
WHO

TO
HIM
IN
THE
GARDEN
